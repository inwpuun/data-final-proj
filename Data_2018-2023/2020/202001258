                "abstracts": "© 2020 Elsevier LtdThis paper examines the use of natural jute fabric reinforced polymer (JFRP) composite sheets as external strengthening material of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Pre-damaged RC beam specimens are prepared to represent seismic damage. The shear behaviour of pre-damaged deep RC beams strengthened with JFRP sheets are investigated subjected to non-reversed cyclic three-point bending load test. The JFRP strengthening ratio and the pre-damaged level of RC beam are considered in this study. The test results revealed that JFRP can significantly improve the shear strength capacity of beams. All strengthened beams show a similar failure mode which is a rupture on JFRP sheets. The shear enhancement of JFRP strengthened pre-damaged beams are comparable to that of non-damaged beams strengthened with conventional FRPs, proving the applicability of JFRP strengthening in pre-damaged shear-deficient beams. In addition, the experimental results are compared with the predicted values by the Japanese design codes.",

        "dc:description": "This paper examines the use of natural jute fabric reinforced polymer (JFRP) composite sheets as external strengthening material of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Pre-damaged RC beam specimens are prepared to represent seismic damage. The shear behaviour of pre-damaged deep RC beams strengthened with JFRP sheets are investigated subjected to non-reversed cyclic three-point bending load test. The JFRP strengthening ratio and the pre-damaged level of RC beam are considered in this study. The test results revealed that JFRP can significantly improve the shear strength capacity of beams. All strengthened beams show a similar failure mode which is a rupture on JFRP sheets. The shear enhancement of JFRP strengthened pre-damaged beams are comparable to that of non-damaged beams strengthened with conventional FRPs, proving the applicability of JFRP strengthening in pre-damaged shear-deficient beams. In addition, the experimental results are compared with the predicted values by the Japanese design codes.",
