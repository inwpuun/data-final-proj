It discusses the overt judicial control of such terms under the 1997 Unfair Contract Terms Act and other protective mechanisms under specific consumer legislation. It also analyses how the Thai courts have exercised a more indirect control by employing traditional general contract law doctrines, including the rules on procedural fairness, in order to protect parties against the imposition of unfair terms. Empirical evidence is provided to show that effective overall consumer protection has been established since the 1990s.",

        "dc:description": "The chapter gives an account of consumer protection in Thailand and, more specifically, how Thai contract law deals with extremely one-sided, onerous, or otherwise unfair terms, such as exclusions or limitations of liability, penalty clauses, or restraint of trade clauses. It discusses the overt judicial control of such terms under the 1997 Unfair Contract Terms Act and other protective mechanisms under specific consumer legislation. It also analyses how the Thai courts have exercised a more indirect control by employing traditional general contract law doctrines, including the rules on procedural fairness, in order to protect parties against the imposition of unfair terms. Empirical evidence is provided to show that effective overall consumer protection has been established since the 1990s.",
