                "abstracts": "© 2020 American Chemical Society.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a crucial component in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that contributes to both pathogenicity as well as immunity against pathogenic bacteria. Typical LPS contains GlcN disaccharide as the core of lipid A. However, some bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospira interrogans contain GlcN3N in lipid A instead. This modification has been shown to dampen the host immune response and increase resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, investigation of the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of GlcN3N has promising applications in the development of vaccines, antibiotics, or usage of the enzymes in chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified LPS. Here, we describe biochemical and structural investigation of GnnA from A. ferrooxidans (AfGnnA) that is responsible for oxidation of UDP-GlcNAc, which subsequently undergoes transamination to produce UDP-GlcNAc3N as a precursor for LPS biosynthesis. AfGnnA is specific for NAD+ and UDP-GlcNAc. The crystal structures of AfGnnA in combination with molecular dynamics simulation and mutational analysis suggest the substrate recognition mode and the catalytic mechanism. K91 or H164 is a potential catalytic base in the oxidation reaction. The results will not only provide insights into the biosynthesis of unusual LPS but will also lay the foundation for development of more immunogenic vaccines, novel antibiotics, or utilization of GnnA in the synthesis of UDP-sugars or modified LPS.",

        "dc:description": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a crucial component in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that contributes to both pathogenicity as well as immunity against pathogenic bacteria. Typical LPS contains GlcN disaccharide as the core of lipid A. However, some bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Leptospira interrogans contain GlcN3N in lipid A instead. This modification has been shown to dampen the host immune response and increase resistance to antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, investigation of the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of GlcN3N has promising applications in the development of vaccines, antibiotics, or usage of the enzymes in chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified LPS. Here, we describe biochemical and structural investigation of GnnA from A. ferrooxidans (AfGnnA) that is responsible for oxidation of UDP-GlcNAc, which subsequently undergoes transamination to produce UDP-GlcNAc3N as a precursor for LPS biosynthesis. AfGnnA is specific for NAD+ and UDP-GlcNAc. The crystal structures of AfGnnA in combination with molecular dynamics simulation and mutational analysis suggest the substrate recognition mode and the catalytic mechanism. K91 or H164 is a potential catalytic base in the oxidation reaction. The results will not only provide insights into the biosynthesis of unusual LPS but will also lay the foundation for development of more immunogenic vaccines, novel antibiotics, or utilization of GnnA in the synthesis of UDP-sugars or modified LPS.",
