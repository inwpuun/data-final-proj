                "abstracts": "© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Background: Pneumococcal diseases were estimated to cause 1.6 million deaths annually worldwide in 2008, with approximately half of these occurring in children aged under 5 years. The consequences and deaths adversely impact individuals\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 work productivity. Objectives: This study aimed to quantify the potential lifetime productivity loss due to pneumococcal diseases among the pediatric population in Thailand using productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs). Methods: A decision analytic model was used to estimate the burden of pneumococcal diseases among the current Thai population aged 0\u20135 years and followed up until aged 99 years or death. Base-case analysis compared years of life and PALYs lost to pneumococcal diseases. Scenario analyses investigated the benefits of prevention with pneumococcal conjugated vaccine 13 (PCV 13). All health outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Results: The base-case analysis estimated that 453,401 years of life and 457,598 PALYs would be lost to pneumococcal diseases, equating to a loss of US$5586 (95% CI 3338\u201310,302) million. Vaccination with PCV13 at birth was estimated to save 82,609 years of life and 93,759 PALYs, which equated to US$1144 (95% CI 367\u20132591) million in economic benefits. The incidence of pneumonia in those aged 0\u20134 years, vaccine efficacy, and the assumed period of protection were key determinants of the health economic outputs. Conclusions: The disease and financial burden of pneumococcal diseases in Thailand is significant, but a large proportion of this is potentially preventable with vaccination.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Pneumococcal diseases were estimated to cause 1.6 million deaths annually worldwide in 2008, with approximately half of these occurring in children aged under 5 years. The consequences and deaths adversely impact individuals\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 work productivity. Objectives: This study aimed to quantify the potential lifetime productivity loss due to pneumococcal diseases among the pediatric population in Thailand using productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs). Methods: A decision analytic model was used to estimate the burden of pneumococcal diseases among the current Thai population aged 0\u20135 years and followed up until aged 99 years or death. Base-case analysis compared years of life and PALYs lost to pneumococcal diseases. Scenario analyses investigated the benefits of prevention with pneumococcal conjugated vaccine 13 (PCV 13). All health outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Results: The base-case analysis estimated that 453,401 years of life and 457,598 PALYs would be lost to pneumococcal diseases, equating to a loss of US$5586 (95% CI 3338\u201310,302) million. Vaccination with PCV13 at birth was estimated to save 82,609 years of life and 93,759 PALYs, which equated to US$1144 (95% CI 367\u20132591) million in economic benefits. The incidence of pneumonia in those aged 0\u20134 years, vaccine efficacy, and the assumed period of protection were key determinants of the health economic outputs. Conclusions: The disease and financial burden of pneumococcal diseases in Thailand is significant, but a large proportion of this is potentially preventable with vaccination.",
