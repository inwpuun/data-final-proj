                "abstracts": "© 15th International Symposium on East Asian Resources Recycling Technology, EARTH 2019. All rights reserved.International forecasting agencies suggest that economic growth per capita of population will be faster in Asia than in any other region. With an increasing demand of higher living standards and a rapidly growing population, the resource shortage is even more pressing. It has long been understood that the stage of a country's development has important implications for its use of metal raw materials. This paper collects the related data to identify the flow of copper including the primary sources from mining and the secondary recycling sources within the region. Electrical appliances and electronic waste (e-waste) are the principle sources of secondary copper from recycling. However, e-waste recycling has always posed significant challenges, including the implementation of reverse logistics mechanisms, the illegal exporting of e-waste and challenging in effective material separation especially in the developing countries in Asia. The traditional development models rooted in \u201ctake, make and waste\u201d, need to be replaced by alternative models of growth to ensure long-term sustainability through the circular economy. In a circular economy, the use of scarce resources through disruptive technology and business models based on longevity, renewability, reuse, repair, upgrade, refurbishment, capacity sharing, and dematerialization. This paper identifies the policy responses of the developing countries in order to reduce the impact from informal e-waste recycling.",

        "dc:description": "International forecasting agencies suggest that economic growth per capita of population will be faster in Asia than in any other region. With an increasing demand of higher living standards and a rapidly growing population, the resource shortage is even more pressing. It has long been understood that the stage of a country's development has important implications for its use of metal raw materials. This paper collects the related data to identify the flow of copper including the primary sources from mining and the secondary recycling sources within the region. Electrical appliances and electronic waste (e-waste) are the principle sources of secondary copper from recycling. However, e-waste recycling has always posed significant challenges, including the implementation of reverse logistics mechanisms, the illegal exporting of e-waste and challenging in effective material separation especially in the developing countries in Asia. The traditional development models rooted in \u201ctake, make and waste\u201d, need to be replaced by alternative models of growth to ensure long-term sustainability through the circular economy. In a circular economy, the use of scarce resources through disruptive technology and business models based on longevity, renewability, reuse, repair, upgrade, refurbishment, capacity sharing, and dematerialization. This paper identifies the policy responses of the developing countries in order to reduce the impact from informal e-waste recycling.",
