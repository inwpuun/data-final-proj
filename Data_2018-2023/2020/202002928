This mismanagement can cause many negative effects to both environment and the quality of life of the residential area nearby. One of the common mismanagements for WEEE in Thailand is mostly occurred for WEEE waste collection centers, leading to high possibilities in contamination and spreading of hazardous materials. In this study, the waste collecting area in the north-eastern part of Thailand were selected as an investigation area for monitoring and analyzing the collection-route of the WEEE. Geographic Information System (GIS) were applied to demonstrates the collecting route of the wastes and the precise location of the stakeholders in waste collection and transportation based on recorded GPS data from 9 GPS device, attached to 12 pick-up trucks. The results showed that WEEE was transported from nearby provinces which mainly were Khon Kaen, Chaiyaphum, and Nakhon Ratchasima. Spatial analysis, considered to be one of the most effective geographical method, were applied to designate the suitable area or coordinates based on significant criteria which was regulations regarding to water resources, residential area, and airport. The information of waste collecting route, land use, water resources and regulations were integrated in order to specify the suitable area for the developing of the official WEEE waste collection center. The results of the study indicate that current wastes collection area and transportation should be diminished and the suitable area for setting up the new center can be specified.",

This mismanagement can cause many negative effects to both environment and the quality of life of the residential area nearby. One of the common mismanagements for WEEE in Thailand is mostly occurred for WEEE waste collection centers, leading to high possibilities in contamination and spreading of hazardous materials. In this study, the waste collecting area in the north-eastern part of Thailand were selected as an investigation area for monitoring and analyzing the collection-route of the WEEE. Geographic Information System (GIS) were applied to demonstrates the collecting route of the wastes and the precise location of the stakeholders in waste collection and transportation based on recorded GPS data from 9 GPS device, attached to 12 pick-up trucks. The results showed that WEEE was transported from nearby provinces which mainly were Khon Kaen, Chaiyaphum, and Nakhon Ratchasima. Spatial analysis, considered to be one of the most effective geographical method, were applied to designate the suitable area or coordinates based on significant criteria which was regulations regarding to water resources, residential area, and airport. The information of waste collecting route, land use, water resources and regulations were integrated in order to specify the suitable area for the developing of the official WEEE waste collection center. The results of the study indicate that current wastes collection area and transportation should be diminished and the suitable area for setting up the new center can be specified.",
