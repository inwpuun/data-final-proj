                "abstracts": "© 2019Rationale & Objective: Patients receiving dialysis report very low physical activity. We implemented a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of a pedometer-based intervention to gather preliminary evidence about its impact on physical activity, symptoms, and surrogates of cardiovascular risk. Study Design: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting & Participants: 60 dialysis patients from San Francisco dialysis clinics. Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receiving pedometers with weekly step goals or usual care for 3 months. Outcomes: The primary outcome was step counts, measured using pedometers. Secondary outcomes included physical performance using the Short Physical Performance Battery, the Physical Function and Vitality scales of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, the Dialysis Symptoms Index, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies\u2013Depression Scale, with endothelial function as a secondary and heart rate variability as an exploratory surrogate measure of cardiovascular risk. Targeted enrollment was 50% and targeted completion was 85%. Results: 49% of approached patients were enrolled, and 92% completed the study. After 3 months, patients randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 30) increased their average daily steps by 2,256 (95% CI, 978-3,537) more than the 30 controls (P < 0.001). Heart rate variability (standard deviation of N-N intervals) increased by 14.94 (95% CI, 0.31-33.56) milliseconds in the intervention group as compared with controls (P = 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences across intervention groups in symptoms, physical performance, or endothelial function. Participants in the intervention group reverted to baseline steps during the postintervention follow-up. Limitations: The Northern California study setting may limit generalizability. Walking does not capture the full spectrum of physical activity. Conclusions: A short-term pedometer-based intervention led to increased step counts in dialysis patients, but the increase was not sustained. Pedometer-based interventions are feasible for dialysis patients, but future studies are needed to address whether more prolonged interventions can improve physical function or symptoms.

        "dc:description": "Rationale & Objective: Patients receiving dialysis report very low physical activity. We implemented a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of a pedometer-based intervention to gather preliminary evidence about its impact on physical activity, symptoms, and surrogates of cardiovascular risk. Study Design: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Setting & Participants: 60 dialysis patients from San Francisco dialysis clinics. Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receiving pedometers with weekly step goals or usual care for 3 months. Outcomes: The primary outcome was step counts, measured using pedometers. Secondary outcomes included physical performance using the Short Physical Performance Battery, the Physical Function and Vitality scales of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, the Dialysis Symptoms Index, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies\u2013Depression Scale, with endothelial function as a secondary and heart rate variability as an exploratory surrogate measure of cardiovascular risk. Targeted enrollment was 50% and targeted completion was 85%. Results: 49% of approached patients were enrolled, and 92% completed the study. After 3 months, patients randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 30) increased their average daily steps by 2,256 (95% CI, 978-3,537) more than the 30 controls (P < 0.001). Heart rate variability (standard deviation of N-N intervals) increased by 14.94 (95% CI, 0.31-33.56) milliseconds in the intervention group as compared with controls (P = 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences across intervention groups in symptoms, physical performance, or endothelial function. Participants in the intervention group reverted to baseline steps during the postintervention follow-up. Limitations: The Northern California study setting may limit generalizability. Walking does not capture the full spectrum of physical activity. Conclusions: A short-term pedometer-based intervention led to increased step counts in dialysis patients, but the increase was not sustained. Pedometer-based interventions are feasible for dialysis patients, but future studies are needed to address whether more prolonged interventions can improve physical function or symptoms. Funding: Supported by grants from the American Kidney Fund, National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and International Society of Nephrology.
