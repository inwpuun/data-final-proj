This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background The concerns of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) about their disease are often different from the objective clinical picture and subject to various influencing factors, including disease progression. Currently our understanding of these concerns is limited, particularly in Asian countries. Methods A 50-item survey on Parkinson\u2019s Disease Patients\u2019 Concerns (PDPC Survey) was developed by a multidisciplinary care team. The subjective greatest concerns (most commonly concerning symptoms) of patients at a specialist centre in Bangkok, Thailand, were explored and categorised according to disease stage and age at onset of PD. Results Data for 222 patients showed concerns varied widely. Motor symptoms giving the greatest concern were problems with walking and/or balance (40.5% of patients), while the most commonly concerning non-motor symptom (NMS) was constipation (41.0%). Patterns were observed amongst different patient subgroups. Early PD patients (H&Y stage 1) were more concerned about NMS than motor symptoms, while the reverse was true for advanced PD patients. Young-onset PD patients showed significantly greater concerns than typical-onset patients about motor symptoms relating to social functioning, working and stigmatisation, such as speech (p = 0.003). Conclusions This study, in an Asian patient cohort, provides an assessment of a wide range of PD patients\u2019 concerns, encompassing not only motor symptoms and NMS, but also treatment-related adverse events, care in the advanced stage, and the need for assistive devices. Identifying the concerns of individual PD patients and implementing a patient-centred approach to care is critical to their wellbeing and optimal outcomes. The PDPC survey can help healthcare teams build a more accurate picture of patients\u2019 experiences to inform clinical management.",

        "dc:description": "Background The concerns of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) about their disease are often different from the objective clinical picture and subject to various influencing factors, including disease progression. Currently our understanding of these concerns is limited, particularly in Asian countries. Methods A 50-item survey on Parkinson\u2019s Disease Patients\u2019 Concerns (PDPC Survey) was developed by a multidisciplinary care team. The subjective greatest concerns (most commonly concerning symptoms) of patients at a specialist centre in Bangkok, Thailand, were explored and categorised according to disease stage and age at onset of PD. Results Data for 222 patients showed concerns varied widely. Motor symptoms giving the greatest concern were problems with walking and/or balance (40.5% of patients), while the most commonly concerning non-motor symptom (NMS) was constipation (41.0%). Patterns were observed amongst different patient subgroups. Early PD patients (H&Y stage 1) were more concerned about NMS than motor symptoms, while the reverse was true for advanced PD patients. Young-onset PD patients showed significantly greater concerns than typical-onset patients about motor symptoms relating to social functioning, working and stigmatisation, such as speech (p = 0.003). Conclusions This study, in an Asian patient cohort, provides an assessment of a wide range of PD patients\u2019 concerns, encompassing not only motor symptoms and NMS, but also treatment-related adverse events, care in the advanced stage, and the need for assistive devices. Identifying the concerns of individual PD patients and implementing a patient-centred approach to care is critical to their wellbeing and optimal outcomes. The PDPC survey can help healthcare teams build a more accurate picture of patients\u2019 experiences to inform clinical management.",
