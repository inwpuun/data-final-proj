                "abstracts": "© JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND | 2020.Background: In massive bleeding trauma patients, the use of massive transfusion protocol (MTP) has been shown to improve the outcome. However, the triggers for MTP activation vary among institutions. One of the most commonly used scoring systems to predict massive transfusion (MT) is the assessment of blood consumption (ABC) score. The authors\u2019 institution has used a simple clinical criterion, the Class-4 Hemorrhage Unresponsive to Lactated Ringer\u2019s (CHULA criteria), as a trigger for MTP activation. Objective: To identify the accuracy of CHULA criteria for MTP activation in trauma patients. Materials and Methods: Between April 2013 and April 2016, the authors retrospectively collected the data of trauma patients receiving blood transfusion in the first 24 hours at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, including demographic data, trauma scores, amount of blood transfusion, and mortality. The detail of CHULA criteria included 1) a patient with clinical signs of Class-4 hemorrhage, 2) not responding to one to two liters of Lactated Ringer\u2019s bolus, and 3) had suspected ongoing bleeding. MT was defined as 1) packed red blood cells (PRC) transfusion of equal to or greater than 10 units in 24 hours, or 2) PRC transfusion of more than four units in the first hour. The accuracy of CHULA criteria for MTP activation was analyzed. Comparison between CHULA criteria and ABC score (of equal to or greater than 2) was also performed. Results: Three hundred fifty-eight patients were included in the present study, 292 males and 66 females. The mechanisms of injury were 68% blunt and 32% penetrating, with an average injury severity score of 21. MTP was activated by CHULA criteria in 100 patients and 73 received MT. Of the 258 patients who did not meet CHULA criteria, five received MT. As a trigger for MT activation, CHULA criteria had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93.6%, 90.4%, and 91%, respectively; while ABC score had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 62.8%, 78.9%, and 75.4%, respectively. Conclusion: CHULA criteria can predict MT in trauma patients with 91% accuracy. When compared with ABC score, CHULA criteria were not inferior to ABC score in predicting MT.",

        "dc:description": "Background: In massive bleeding trauma patients, the use of massive transfusion protocol (MTP) has been shown to improve the outcome. However, the triggers for MTP activation vary among institutions. One of the most commonly used scoring systems to predict massive transfusion (MT) is the assessment of blood consumption (ABC) score. The authors\u2019 institution has used a simple clinical criterion, the Class-4 Hemorrhage Unresponsive to Lactated Ringer\u2019s (CHULA criteria), as a trigger for MTP activation. Objective: To identify the accuracy of CHULA criteria for MTP activation in trauma patients. Materials and Methods: Between April 2013 and April 2016, the authors retrospectively collected the data of trauma patients receiving blood transfusion in the first 24 hours at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, including demographic data, trauma scores, amount of blood transfusion, and mortality. The detail of CHULA criteria included 1) a patient with clinical signs of Class-4 hemorrhage, 2) not responding to one to two liters of Lactated Ringer\u2019s bolus, and 3) had suspected ongoing bleeding. MT was defined as 1) packed red blood cells (PRC) transfusion of equal to or greater than 10 units in 24 hours, or 2) PRC transfusion of more than four units in the first hour. The accuracy of CHULA criteria for MTP activation was analyzed. Comparison between CHULA criteria and ABC score (of equal to or greater than 2) was also performed. Results: Three hundred fifty-eight patients were included in the present study, 292 males and 66 females. The mechanisms of injury were 68% blunt and 32% penetrating, with an average injury severity score of 21. MTP was activated by CHULA criteria in 100 patients and 73 received MT. Of the 258 patients who did not meet CHULA criteria, five received MT. As a trigger for MT activation, CHULA criteria had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93.6%, 90.4%, and 91%, respectively; while ABC score had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 62.8%, 78.9%, and 75.4%, respectively. Conclusion: CHULA criteria can predict MT in trauma patients with 91% accuracy. When compared with ABC score, CHULA criteria were not inferior to ABC score in predicting MT.",
