All rights reserved.Introduction: Primary care pharmacy is crucial for community pharmacists and requires special training for some services. Objective: This study aims to explore current training needs of community pharmacists for primary care pharmacy using the Organization-Task-Person (O-T-P) model. Methods: A qualitative study with a semi-structured interview was conducted in key informants who were purposively recruited using a snowball technique. All interviews using an interview guide and lasted 35-60 minutes. They were audiotaped, transcribed, translated and checked for accuracy. Data were coded with a thematic analysis and ratio presentation. Results: Ten key informants were interviewed, and mostly experienced community pharmacists or pharmaceutical regulators. Primary care pharmacy was expressed at the task, personal and organizational levels, i.e., 4, 3 and 2 themes, respectively. Primary care services were categorized as basic and advanced practices. Some barriers to advanced services, e.g., vaccination and no fees for services. Perceived knowledge and skills were focused on continuing professional education for lifelong learning, whereas perceived attitudes were negative for business-oriented services, ethics and responsibilities for professional practices. Special basic training was not needed, but some advances services were required (e.g., behavioral modifications and home visits). Conclusion: Professional development programs should be arranged to help pharmacists better provide advanced services.",

Objective: This study aims to explore current training needs of community pharmacists for primary care pharmacy using the Organization-Task-Person (O-T-P) model. Methods: A qualitative study with a semi-structured interview was conducted in key informants who were purposively recruited using a snowball technique. All interviews using an interview guide and lasted 35-60 minutes. They were audiotaped, transcribed, translated and checked for accuracy. Data were coded with a thematic analysis and ratio presentation. Results: Ten key informants were interviewed, and mostly experienced community pharmacists or pharmaceutical regulators. Primary care pharmacy was expressed at the task, personal and organizational levels, i.e., 4, 3 and 2 themes, respectively. Primary care services were categorized as basic and advanced practices. Some barriers to advanced services, e.g., vaccination and no fees for services. Perceived knowledge and skills were focused on continuing professional education for lifelong learning, whereas perceived attitudes were negative for business-oriented services, ethics and responsibilities for professional practices. Special basic training was not needed, but some advances services were required (e.g., behavioral modifications and home visits). Conclusion: Professional development programs should be arranged to help pharmacists better provide advanced services.",
