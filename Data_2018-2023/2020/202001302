                "abstracts": "Â© 2020 Nakhara: Journal of Environmental Design and Planning. All rights reserved.This paper aims to examine a prospect of disaster education and community development in Thailand focusing on a traditional waterfront community, named Hua Takhe. It explores the program and participation as well as meaning and implication of the Japanese cases through observations. Based on the analysis of questionnaire surveys, the strengths of the Hua Takhe community include solidarity, human, cultural, and educational resources. Its weaknesses are a limitation of disaster prevention-related resources, insufficient interaction between the old and the young generations, a lack of systematic disaster management, and low participation in drills. Collaboration with educational institutions, integrative and inclusive learning, and a better quality of life can be its opportunities; however, changing the usage of dwellings and an unbalanced development can be its threats. While the proposed workshop for children focuses on identifying the disaster prevention-related components and storytelling of Japanese and Thai wisdom, the workshop for multigenerational residents emphasizes identifying risks, discussing about the CBDRM, and participating in the community's festival. Concentrating on community engagement comprises of sharing the survey results, group discussion, hands on experience in investigating the living environment and making a hazard map.",

        "dc:description": "This paper aims to examine a prospect of disaster education and community development in Thailand focusing on a traditional waterfront community, named Hua Takhe. It explores the program and participation as well as meaning and implication of the Japanese cases through observations. Based on the analysis of questionnaire surveys, the strengths of the Hua Takhe community include solidarity, human, cultural, and educational resources. Its weaknesses are a limitation of disaster prevention-related resources, insufficient interaction between the old and the young generations, a lack of systematic disaster management, and low participation in drills. Collaboration with educational institutions, integrative and inclusive learning, and a better quality of life can be its opportunities; however, changing the usage of dwellings and an unbalanced development can be its threats. While the proposed workshop for children focuses on identifying the disaster prevention-related components and storytelling of Japanese and Thai wisdom, the workshop for multigenerational residents emphasizes identifying risks, discussing about the CBDRM, and participating in the community's festival. Concentrating on community engagement comprises of sharing the survey results, group discussion, hands on experience in investigating the living environment and making a hazard map.",
