                "abstracts": "Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Capacity planning, which is integral to resource selection and allocation, is an important task in manufacturing system design. As budget is limited, investment in resources must be done carefully and appropriately in order to achieve desired capacity and system efficiency. One of the most expensive and valuable resources in the manufacturing system is machinery. Therefore, selecting an appropriate machine is of high significance. Among many types of manufacturing systems, intermittent manufacturing system is complex, yet flexible. The intermittent manufacturing system enables manufacturers to produce multiple products using multiple processes and multiple machines. The system comprises a network of multiple types of multi-process machines. A machine selection problem in the context of the intermittent manufacturing system is a delicate process, as it must correspond appropriately with production complexities. To alleviate this problem, we develop a decision support system for solving the machine selection problem in an intermittent manufacturing system design. We study several manufacturing systems producing multiple types of products with various multi-process machines to lay out the framework. This decision support system consists of four main parts, namely; data entry, data conversion, optimization model and report. To solve the machine selection problem, an optimization technique is used to identify the optimal number of machines and the allocation of production process of each machine. The objective of this optimization problem is to minimize total production costs (machine cost and operating cost) while maintaining production capacity and other production constraints. The decision support system is developed for and validated with the manufacturing company.",

        "dc:description": "Capacity planning, which is integral to resource selection and allocation, is an important task in manufacturing system design. As budget is limited, investment in resources must be done carefully and appropriately in order to achieve desired capacity and system efficiency. One of the most expensive and valuable resources in the manufacturing system is machinery. Therefore, selecting an appropriate machine is of high significance. Among many types of manufacturing systems, intermittent manufacturing system is complex, yet flexible. The intermittent manufacturing system enables manufacturers to produce multiple products using multiple processes and multiple machines. The system comprises a network of multiple types of multi-process machines. A machine selection problem in the context of the intermittent manufacturing system is a delicate process, as it must correspond appropriately with production complexities. To alleviate this problem, we develop a decision support system for solving the machine selection problem in an intermittent manufacturing system design. We study several manufacturing systems producing multiple types of products with various multi-process machines to lay out the framework. This decision support system consists of four main parts, namely; data entry, data conversion, optimization model and report. To solve the machine selection problem, an optimization technique is used to identify the optimal number of machines and the allocation of production process of each machine. The objective of this optimization problem is to minimize total production costs (machine cost and operating cost) while maintaining production capacity and other production constraints. The decision support system is developed for and validated with the manufacturing company.",
