                "abstracts": "© 2020 Friends Science Publishers.The objective of this study was to characterize the salt-tolerance mechanism of rice chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) with the 'KDML105' genetic background. These CSSLs differed regarding the length of their drought-tolerance quantitative trait locus segment from chromosome 1 (DT-QTL1) of the doubled haploid donor, DH212. Twenty-nine CSSLs were screened for salt-tolerance based on the salt injury score and seedling growth traits under a severe salt stress condition (150 mM NaCl). CSSL11 and CSSL18 were identified to have the potential to be salt tolerant lines according to their appearance under 150 mM NaCl treatment, while CSSL22 had the highest shoot fresh weight and CSSL14 had the highest shoot dry weight, when compared among CSSLs. Therefore, four CSSLs (CSSL11, CSSL14, CSSL18, and CSSL22) were evaluated further regarding their shoot responses to moderate (75 mM NaCl) and severe (150 mM NaCl) salt stresses. All four CSSLs had high shoot fresh weights after an 8-day exposure to moderate stress, indicating the salt-tolerance of the aboveground tissues. Among the CSSLs, CSSL18 had the highest shoot fresh weight after a 12-day salt stress treatment. Moreover, the midday leaf water potential of CSSL18 was greater than that of the parental lines and similar to that of 'Pokkali' (salttolerant standard line). Furthermore, Na+/K+ ratios of CSSL18 and both parental lines did not show the significant difference, suggesting that DT-QTL1 segment of DH212 does not contain the ion homeostasis trait. In conclusion, the salt-tolerance mechanism of CSSL18 due to DT-QTL1 from DH212 is associated with osmotic adjustments rather than ion homeostasis. Finally, CSSL18 may be suitable for future attempts at identifying the salt-tolerance gene(s) and breeding new salt-tolerant rice varieties.",

        "dc:description": "The objective of this study was to characterize the salt-tolerance mechanism of rice chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) with the 'KDML105' genetic background. These CSSLs differed regarding the length of their drought-tolerance quantitative trait locus segment from chromosome 1 (DT-QTL1) of the doubled haploid donor, DH212. Twenty-nine CSSLs were screened for salt-tolerance based on the salt injury score and seedling growth traits under a severe salt stress condition (150 mM NaCl). CSSL11 and CSSL18 were identified to have the potential to be salt tolerant lines according to their appearance under 150 mM NaCl treatment, while CSSL22 had the highest shoot fresh weight and CSSL14 had the highest shoot dry weight, when compared among CSSLs. Therefore, four CSSLs (CSSL11, CSSL14, CSSL18, and CSSL22) were evaluated further regarding their shoot responses to moderate (75 mM NaCl) and severe (150 mM NaCl) salt stresses. All four CSSLs had high shoot fresh weights after an 8-day exposure to moderate stress, indicating the salt-tolerance of the aboveground tissues. Among the CSSLs, CSSL18 had the highest shoot fresh weight after a 12-day salt stress treatment. Moreover, the midday leaf water potential of CSSL18 was greater than that of the parental lines and similar to that of 'Pokkali' (salttolerant standard line). Furthermore, Na+/K+ ratios of CSSL18 and both parental lines did not show the significant difference, suggesting that DT-QTL1 segment of DH212 does not contain the ion homeostasis trait. In conclusion, the salt-tolerance mechanism of CSSL18 due to DT-QTL1 from DH212 is associated with osmotic adjustments rather than ion homeostasis. Finally, CSSL18 may be suitable for future attempts at identifying the salt-tolerance gene(s) and breeding new salt-tolerant rice varieties.",
