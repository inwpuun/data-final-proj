                {"$": "Viriya Sawangchot, in his paper Creative City and the Sustainable Life (2016), identifies another key group of agents of change for the development of creative cities as \u201ccreative class subcultures.\u201d They are usually culturally marginal and their creative spaces are often not included in the creative city model created by the government, even though they could make a substantial positive impact to the city. Along with the Institute of Islamic Art Thailand, Teater Garasi/Garasi Performance Institute14 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia is an example of a creative class subculture that has succeeded in gaining recognition and securing funding locally and internationally. Described as a \u201ccollective,\u201d Teater Garasi strives to generate discussion and public engagement with regard to changes and social issues in the world today. In the beginning, members of the collective had to pay for their own expenses in their works or take cuts from the ticket sales, but in 2000 a new, more systematic fundraising plan was established when they began to tour to other countries, including Singapore, Germany, Japan, USA, and the Netherlands. Subsequently, they have been financially supported by organizations such as Open Society Foundations, the Royal Netherlands Embassy, and the Ford Foundation. With little support from the local government, Teater Garasi has become an important actor in the boosting of creativity in the city of Yogyakarta through their perseverance, effective management, and fundraising strategies, as well as their drive to create a sustainable, creative, and socially engaging environment for the city."},

All rights reserved.This study attempts to critically examine practices towards building sustainable creative cities in ASEAN, particularly Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. The main aim is to identify key factors for sustainable creative cities by means of qualitative data analysis. The results show that to create a sustainable creative city in ASEAN government leaders must not focus on the designation of UNESCO Creative City as a goal for the economy, but as a firm commitment towards sustainable development. Creativity should be reinforced through art education from an early age. The distinction as well as the relationship between the terms \u201cculture\u201d and \u201ccreativity\u201d must be made apparent in cultural policies, while the classification of creative activities should be redefined. Diversity and inclusion, not only in culture but also in art forms and genres, must be embraced as it allows for more freedom and possibilities in the development of creativity, especially from the bottom up.",

The main aim is to identify key factors for sustainable creative cities by means of qualitative data analysis. The results show that to create a sustainable creative city in ASEAN government leaders must not focus on the designation of UNESCO Creative City as a goal for the economy, but as a firm commitment towards sustainable development. Creativity should be reinforced through art education from an early age. The distinction as well as the relationship between the terms \u201cculture\u201d and \u201ccreativity\u201d must be made apparent in cultural policies, while the classification of creative activities should be redefined. Diversity and inclusion, not only in culture but also in art forms and genres, must be embraced as it allows for more freedom and possibilities in the development of creativity, especially from the bottom up.",
