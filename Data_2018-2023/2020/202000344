                "abstracts": "Copyright © 2020 the authorsThere are two types of dystonic tremor syndromes (DTS), dystonic tremor (DT) and tremor associated with dystonia (TAWD), and neither is understood. DTS likely share some mechanisms with nontremulous dystonia, and there may also be overlaps with essential tremor (ET). We studied 21 ET (8 females, 13 males) and 22 DTS human patients (10 females, 12 males), including 13 human patients with DT (writer\u2019s cramp with writing tremor) and 9 human patients with tremor associated with dystonia (TAWD; cervical dystonia with hand tremor). Tremors were analyzed using accelerometry and surface EMG of the antagonist pairs of arm muscles during posture, simple kinetic movement, and writing. Cerebellar inhibition was performed to assess cerebello-thalamo-cortical involvement. DT exhibited higher variability of peak frequency and greater instability of tremor burst intervals over time (higher tremor stability index) than ET or TAWD regardless of tasks. Intermuscular coherence magnitude between the antagonist pairs increased during the writing task in DT, but not ET or TAWD. ET and TAWD exhibited different phase relationships of the temporal fluctuations of voluntary movement and tremor in the kinetic condition. A linear discriminant classifier based on these tremor parameters was able to distinguish the three groups with a classification accuracy of 95.1%. Cerebellar inhibition was significantly reduced in DT, but not in TAWD, compared with ET and healthy controls. Our study shows that the two DTS are distinct entities with DT closer to nontremorous dystonia and TAWD closer to ET.",

        "dc:description": "There are two types of dystonic tremor syndromes (DTS), dystonic tremor (DT) and tremor associated with dystonia (TAWD), and neither is understood. DTS likely share some mechanisms with nontremulous dystonia, and there may also be overlaps with essential tremor (ET). We studied 21 ET (8 females, 13 males) and 22 DTS human patients (10 females, 12 males), including 13 human patients with DT (writer\u2019s cramp with writing tremor) and 9 human patients with tremor associated with dystonia (TAWD; cervical dystonia with hand tremor). Tremors were analyzed using accelerometry and surface EMG of the antagonist pairs of arm muscles during posture, simple kinetic movement, and writing. Cerebellar inhibition was performed to assess cerebello-thalamo-cortical involvement. DT exhibited higher variability of peak frequency and greater instability of tremor burst intervals over time (higher tremor stability index) than ET or TAWD regardless of tasks. Intermuscular coherence magnitude between the antagonist pairs increased during the writing task in DT, but not ET or TAWD. ET and TAWD exhibited different phase relationships of the temporal fluctuations of voluntary movement and tremor in the kinetic condition. A linear discriminant classifier based on these tremor parameters was able to distinguish the three groups with a classification accuracy of 95.1%. Cerebellar inhibition was significantly reduced in DT, but not in TAWD, compared with ET and healthy controls. Our study shows that the two DTS are distinct entities with DT closer to nontremorous dystonia and TAWD closer to ET.",
