                "abstracts": "© 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.The recent residue solid waste management has become a significant global concern. Due to the increase of population, the economic growth and the urban expansion, the number of solid waste has heavily risen. However, there are still lack of an appropriated solid waste management. According to Tan Deaw soild waste survey report in 2019 (Regional Environmental Office 7 Saraburi, 2018), it revealed that Tan Deaw sub-district has been facing critical solid waste management issues. This area produced 9.41 metric tons per day, while the appropriated solid waste disposal management was less than 40 percent and residue waste remains around 2,000 MTs. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to develop learning community and public awareness towards the appropriated solid waste disposal management, including 3Rs principle, to develop the systemic solid waste management strategies with the engagement from all stakeholders, and to promote and support collaborative activities among local people in the community and the concerned stakeholders in the solid waste management. A systemic approach, through participatory action research between Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) (Checkland & Scholes, 1990; Checkland & Poulter, 2006) and Critical Systems Heuristic (CSH) (Ulrich, 1983), is a significant application for structuring the process of collecting perspective from all stakeholders, exploring the key problems of solid waste management, and finding out strategies to address the key problems in Tan-Deaw solid waste management afterwards. Root definitions and models were generated by stakeholders for two activity systems identified by them for attention: Activities promoting knowledge about solid waste sorting and a community waste bank. The findings explored the seven strategies to address Tan-Deaw solid waste management problems in two aspects. This research contributes to both theoretical and practical contributions. In terms of the theoretical contribution, the application of systemic approach conducts a significant knowledge surrounding solid waste management problem solving. Regarding the practical implication, the strategies will address the solid waste problems and barriers in the area with the cooperation of all concerned stakeholders.",

        "dc:description": "The recent residue solid waste management has become a significant global concern. Due to the increase of population, the economic growth and the urban expansion, the number of solid waste has heavily risen. However, there are still lack of an appropriated solid waste management. According to Tan Deaw soild waste survey report in 2019 (Regional Environmental Office 7 Saraburi, 2018), it revealed that Tan Deaw sub-district has been facing critical solid waste management issues. This area produced 9.41 metric tons per day, while the appropriated solid waste disposal management was less than 40 percent and residue waste remains around 2,000 MTs. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to develop learning community and public awareness towards the appropriated solid waste disposal management, including 3Rs principle, to develop the systemic solid waste management strategies with the engagement from all stakeholders, and to promote and support collaborative activities among local people in the community and the concerned stakeholders in the solid waste management. A systemic approach, through participatory action research between Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) (Checkland & Scholes, 1990; Checkland & Poulter, 2006) and Critical Systems Heuristic (CSH) (Ulrich, 1983), is a significant application for structuring the process of collecting perspective from all stakeholders, exploring the key problems of solid waste management, and finding out strategies to address the key problems in Tan-Deaw solid waste management afterwards. Root definitions and models were generated by stakeholders for two activity systems identified by them for attention: Activities promoting knowledge about solid waste sorting and a community waste bank. The findings explored the seven strategies to address Tan-Deaw solid waste management problems in two aspects. This research contributes to both theoretical and practical contributions. In terms of the theoretical contribution, the application of systemic approach conducts a significant knowledge surrounding solid waste management problem solving. Regarding the practical implication, the strategies will address the solid waste problems and barriers in the area with the cooperation of all concerned stakeholders.",
