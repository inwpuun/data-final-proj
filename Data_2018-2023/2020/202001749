Research instruments were questionnaires and group discussion, and research samples were 196 TSU support staff selected by stratified random sampling Mean and standard deviation statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data of this research study, and PNImodified was used for content analysis of die qualitative data. The research findings presented that TSU support staff need a better understanding of the scope of the study, research report writing, research issues, literature review, research design, research framework, and research ethics and morality to enhance their research competency because they lack understanding and abilitytowards research methodology including place, budgeting, learning resources, mentoring system and learning support projects. They also lack faith, confidence, and intention in doing research. A possible solution seems to be the application of research knowledge management procedures, including a plan for learning facilities such as place, budgeting, learning resources, mentoring team learning support projects, research ethics, and faith encouragement Moreover, a research competency enhancement process based on knowledge management procedures for developing R2R for TSU support staff is a 2P2R process consisting of four steps: plan, process, reflect and regard.",

Research instruments were questionnaires and group discussion, and research samples were 196 TSU support staff selected by stratified random sampling Mean and standard deviation statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data of this research study, and PNImodified was used for content analysis of die qualitative data. The research findings presented that TSU support staff need a better understanding of the scope of the study, research report writing, research issues, literature review, research design, research framework, and research ethics and morality to enhance their research competency because they lack understanding and abilitytowards research methodology including place, budgeting, learning resources, mentoring system and learning support projects. They also lack faith, confidence, and intention in doing research. A possible solution seems to be the application of research knowledge management procedures, including a plan for learning facilities such as place, budgeting, learning resources, mentoring team learning support projects, research ethics, and faith encouragement Moreover, a research competency enhancement process based on knowledge management procedures for developing R2R for TSU support staff is a 2P2R process consisting of four steps: plan, process, reflect and regard.",
