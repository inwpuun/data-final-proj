All rights reservedObjectives: To validate the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) for use in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) and to provide cross-sectional analysis of anxiety, depressive and distress symptoms in patients with OLP. Methods: Validity and reliability of both instruments were assessed in 260 participants with OLP in one tertiary oral medicine centre through confirmatory factor analysis and calculation of reliability coefficients. Prevalence, clinical and demographic predictors of the presence of psychological symptoms in OLP were calculated and identified using multivariated logistic regression. Results: Factor analysis results demonstrated that a bifactor model described the underlying structure of both scales better than other models. Values of omega indicated adequate reliability of total HADS and PSS-10 score while low coefficient omega hierarchical values limit clinical applicability of their subscale scores. The prevalence of anxiety, depressive and distress symptoms in OLP was 39.23%, 20.77% and 27.69%, respectively. Pain intensity, disease comorbidities, age, smoking and alcohol consumption were found to be independent predictors of the presence of psychological symptoms in OLP. Conclusion: The HADS and PSS-10 are appropriate to use as general measures of psychological distress and perceived stress in patients with OLP.",

Methods: Validity and reliability of both instruments were assessed in 260 participants with OLP in one tertiary oral medicine centre through confirmatory factor analysis and calculation of reliability coefficients. Prevalence, clinical and demographic predictors of the presence of psychological symptoms in OLP were calculated and identified using multivariated logistic regression. Results: Factor analysis results demonstrated that a bifactor model described the underlying structure of both scales better than other models. Values of omega indicated adequate reliability of total HADS and PSS-10 score while low coefficient omega hierarchical values limit clinical applicability of their subscale scores. The prevalence of anxiety, depressive and distress symptoms in OLP was 39.23%, 20.77% and 27.69%, respectively. Pain intensity, disease comorbidities, age, smoking and alcohol consumption were found to be independent predictors of the presence of psychological symptoms in OLP. Conclusion: The HADS and PSS-10 are appropriate to use as general measures of psychological distress and perceived stress in patients with OLP.",
