The research followed a multi-site exploratory case study based on the framework of learning-centered leadership on promoting TPL and information technology leadership. Semi-structured in-depth interviews, observations and school documents were primary sources for qualitative data analysis. Findings revealed that all three cases shared common features that advance technology-based teacher learning: having technology enhanced learning visions; being a model learning leader; managing empowered, collaborative, technology-infused, job-embedded learning; and creating conditions to support and sustain digital learning. There were distinct and innovative practices, made possible by technology, which the principals employed to optimize the effectiveness of teacher learning in their settings. The study supported an extensive body of literature that underscored the vital role of learning-centered leadership for teacher learning. It also highlighted the importance of technology for learning and adaptive leadership practices across different school settings. This study will contribute to better understanding how principals react to policies such as Thailand 4.0 and facilitate the integration of technology into TPL.",

The research followed a multi-site exploratory case study based on the framework of learning-centered leadership on promoting TPL and information technology leadership. Semi-structured in-depth interviews, observations and school documents were primary sources for qualitative data analysis. Findings revealed that all three cases shared common features that advance technology-based teacher learning: having technology enhanced learning visions; being a model learning leader; managing empowered, collaborative, technology-infused, job-embedded learning; and creating conditions to support and sustain digital learning. There were distinct and innovative practices, made possible by technology, which the principals employed to optimize the effectiveness of teacher learning in their settings. The study supported an extensive body of literature that underscored the vital role of learning-centered leadership for teacher learning. It also highlighted the importance of technology for learning and adaptive leadership practices across different school settings. This study will contribute to better understanding how principals react to policies such as Thailand 4.0 and facilitate the integration of technology into TPL.",
