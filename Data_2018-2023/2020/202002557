In addition, the direct and indirect effect of job satisfaction, competitive advantage and business sustainability is also examined. For this purpose, a cross-sectional research design was selected. Population of the study were based on the manufacturing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of Thailand. Employees of these SMEs were selected to collect the data. Therefore, respondents of the study were employees of Thai manufacturing SMEs. Various close ended questions related to the concerned study were asked on a five-point Likert scale. Furthermore, this study analyzed the data with the help of Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results of the study revealed that both leadership styles and Industry 4.0 have significant role in organization performance. Leadership styles and Industry 4.0 influence positively on job satisfaction and competitive advantage, respectively. Further, job satisfaction and competitive advantage influence positively on business sustainability. Finally, business sustainability significantly improves organization performance. Therefore, the current study has vital importance for practitioners to enhance organization performance through leadership styles and Industry 4.0.",

In addition, the direct and indirect effect of job satisfaction, competitive advantage and business sustainability is also examined. For this purpose, a cross-sectional research design was selected. Population of the study were based on the manufacturing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of Thailand. Employees of these SMEs were selected to collect the data. Therefore, respondents of the study were employees of Thai manufacturing SMEs. Various close ended questions related to the concerned study were asked on a five-point Likert scale. Furthermore, this study analyzed the data with the help of Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results of the study revealed that both leadership styles and Industry 4.0 have significant role in organization performance. Leadership styles and Industry 4.0 influence positively on job satisfaction and competitive advantage, respectively. Further, job satisfaction and competitive advantage influence positively on business sustainability. Finally, business sustainability significantly improves organization performance. Therefore, the current study has vital importance for practitioners to enhance organization performance through leadership styles and Industry 4.0.",
