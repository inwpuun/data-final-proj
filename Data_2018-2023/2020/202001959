The purpose of this study was to examine the potential diagnostic or prognostic roles of circulating miRNAs in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Methods Paired cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue specimens of patients with HBV-related HCC were used as a discovery set for screening 800 miRNAs by a Nanostring quantitative assay. Differentially expressed miRNAs were then examined by SYBR green quantitative RT-PCR in a validation cohort of serum samples obtained from 70 patients with HBV-related HCC, 70 HBV patients without HCC and 50 healthy controls. Results The discovery set identified miR-223-3p, miR-199a-5p and miR-451a significantly lower expressed in cancerous tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. In the validated cohort, circulating miR-223-3p levels were significantly lower in the HCC group compared with the other groups. The combined use of serum alpha-fetoprotein and miR-223-3p displayed high sensitivity for detecting early HCC (85%) and intermediate/advanced stage HCC (100%). Additionally, serum miR-223-3p had a negative correlation with tumor size and BCLC stage. On multivariate analysis, serum miR-223-3p was identified as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with HCC. In contrast, circulating miRNA-199a-5p and miR-451a did not show any clinical benefit for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that miR-223-3p was differentially expressed in cancerous compared with paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, circulating miRNA-223-3p could represent a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for patients with HBV-related HCC.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential diagnostic or prognostic roles of circulating miRNAs in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Methods Paired cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue specimens of patients with HBV-related HCC were used as a discovery set for screening 800 miRNAs by a Nanostring quantitative assay. Differentially expressed miRNAs were then examined by SYBR green quantitative RT-PCR in a validation cohort of serum samples obtained from 70 patients with HBV-related HCC, 70 HBV patients without HCC and 50 healthy controls. Results The discovery set identified miR-223-3p, miR-199a-5p and miR-451a significantly lower expressed in cancerous tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues. In the validated cohort, circulating miR-223-3p levels were significantly lower in the HCC group compared with the other groups. The combined use of serum alpha-fetoprotein and miR-223-3p displayed high sensitivity for detecting early HCC (85%) and intermediate/advanced stage HCC (100%). Additionally, serum miR-223-3p had a negative correlation with tumor size and BCLC stage. On multivariate analysis, serum miR-223-3p was identified as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with HCC. In contrast, circulating miRNA-199a-5p and miR-451a did not show any clinical benefit for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of HCC. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that miR-223-3p was differentially expressed in cancerous compared with paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, circulating miRNA-223-3p could represent a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for patients with HBV-related HCC.",
