                {"$": "The best-known P2P energy trading project example is the Piclo project, a British online-based P2P energy trading platform that performs P2P energy trading for generators and business consumers. The project began in October 2015 as a trial project after receiving funding from the Energy and Climate Change Department (DECC). The project last for six months in a joint effort between an innovative WHFKQRORJ\\ FRPSDQ\\ FDOOHG ³2SHQ 8WLOLW\\´ DQG D UHQHZDEOH HQHUJ\\ VXSSOLHU FDOOHG ³*RRG (QHUJ\\´. 3LFOR utilized meter information, generator pricing, and consumer preference information to match electricity demand and supply in thirty-minute settlement. Generators were about to control and visibility over who buys electricity from them. Meanwhile, a buyer could choose and prioritize which generators to buy electricity from. Piclo matches generation and consumption according to preferences and locality and provided customers with data visualizations and analytics [11]. The benefit of local generation matching included reducing annual Distribution Use of System (DuoS) charges by up to 39% or ￡20,000 based on trial data from the Eden project. Piclo is not however currently able to achieve reduced DUoS charges for consumers based on consumers purchasing locally generated electricity. Another regulatory barrier is the need for a third-party licensed supplier (TPLS) which impedes the implementation of a true P2P market [5]. Vandebron was established in the Netherlands in 2014 as a for -profit organization. It is a direct renewable energy marketplace between consumers and independent green energy producers, such as local farmers who own wind turbines or solar farms. Vandebron offers an online platform with a variety of renewable energy sources including wind, solar, biofuel, and gas. Customers can select the desired package, including energy producers, the type of electricity generation, the contract duration and the amount of energy required through WKH FRPSDQ\\¶V ZHEVLWH [ ]. $ VWURQJ GULYHU IRU WKLV PRGHO LV WKDW the Netherlands has a deregulated energy market which allows the P2P energy trading model to work directly between independent energy providers and consumers [12]. Sonnen, a German battery storage manufacturer, known as Sonnenbatterie, launched a community energy trading platform called sonnenCommunity in December 2015. It aimed to allow solar PV installers with energy storage to share the excess energy generated with other members in the sonnenCommunity [13]. Sonnenbatterie enables the owner of solar PV systems to generate, store and trade solar PV generated in their batteries. The service combines distributed generation, battery technology, and digital networking to create a new electricity business model between prosumers and consumers in the community. SonnenCommunity subscribers pay a monthly membership fee RI1¼9.99 with a 10-year guarantee for using Sonnenbatterie and receive a low-price electricity rate called Sonnenflat [13,14]. A key driver behind this trading platform is that German regulation does not permit customers to occasionally feed electricity back into the grid once the grid is oversupplied [12]. Another well-known P2P project is the Brooklyn Microgrid (BMG) Project developed by LO3, Consensys, and Siemens in 2016 in New York, United States. The BMG pilot project is an energy marketplace for locally generated renewable energy. The objective of this project is to increase renewable energy generated within the community and improve grid efficiency by reducing the amount of energy lost through transmission under the microgrid concept. Participants who install installed solar PV in this project can trade their excess energy to community members. The kWh can be essentially transacted very efficiently on the P2P network via blockchain technology, which acts as an automated accounting system. However, the system is not linked to settlement and is currently more expensive than buying electricity from utility companies [5]. ,Q DGGLWLRQ 1HZ <RUN VWDWH¶V FXUUHQW UHJXODWLRQV GR not permit local P2P energy trading, with only utilities and retail service providers being permitted to trade energy. BMG pilot project is actively working on this issue to get approval to implement true P2P energy trading [15]. In Thailand, the T77 urban precinct in Bangkok launched a P2P solar rooftop trading trial using blockchain technology, developed by Power Ledger, together with a Thai renewable energy business BCPG. The trial participants include a shopping mall, apartments, a school, and a dental hospital on the Power Ledger platform. This model involves deregulation to support the generation of electricity by communities and private power purchase agreements. With an installed solar rooftop capacity of 635 kilowatts combined with battery storage, the project aims to provide 20% RI WKH FRPPXQLW\\¶V HQWLUH electricity need. The Power Ledger platform will allow individuals and communities in the T77 Precinct to choose the source of their power, while providing a cheap, dependable and low-carbon mechanism to harness energy [16,17]. However, true P2P transactions are not yet underway in this project due to licensed energy supplier and wheeling charge issues (fee for transmission line use)."},

                "abstracts": "© 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.In recent years the power system is undergoing a rapid change from the traditional power system with large-scale power plants to small-scale distributed generations such as wind energy and solar photovoltaic system. In addition, the technology related to the electric business has been developed rapidly, such as solar power development technology, energy storage, and various communication and measurement devices, etc. The development of these technologies together with the reduced cost of technologies is the main factor in the transformation of the electric business model in many countries around the world, including Thailand to the way that electricity users turn from being consumers only to be both consumers and producers of electricity or called as prosumers. Also, it drives to the new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading, where consumers and prosumers can buy or sell electricity locally. However, the concept of peer to peer energy trading is at early stage in Thailand. This study points out the benefits and barriers of peer to peer energy market based on reviewed existing peer to peer energy projects worldwide. The results of study show that the major regulatory barriers that restrictive to peer to peer market in most countries are the licensed energy supplier issue, network charging and no excess generation is fed back into the national grid.",

        "dc:description": "In recent years the power system is undergoing a rapid change from the traditional power system with large-scale power plants to small-scale distributed generations such as wind energy and solar photovoltaic system. In addition, the technology related to the electric business has been developed rapidly, such as solar power development technology, energy storage, and various communication and measurement devices, etc. The development of these technologies together with the reduced cost of technologies is the main factor in the transformation of the electric business model in many countries around the world, including Thailand to the way that electricity users turn from being consumers only to be both consumers and producers of electricity or called as prosumers. Also, it drives to the new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading, where consumers and prosumers can buy or sell electricity locally. However, the concept of peer to peer energy trading is at early stage in Thailand. This study points out the benefits and barriers of peer to peer energy market based on reviewed existing peer to peer energy projects worldwide. The results of study show that the major regulatory barriers that restrictive to peer to peer market in most countries are the licensed energy supplier issue, network charging and no excess generation is fed back into the national grid.",
