The result of this study helps fill the gap in literature about the factor affecting a house-hold\u2019s decision to evacuate in response to the flood, as such a decision varies with the type of natural disas-ter. The result of the study confirms that more vul-nerable people are less likely to evacuate. However, they are more likely to evacuate, if at least one of their household members has reduced mobility. People in flood-prone areas exhibited moral hazards. Further-more, people with relatively secured employment sta-tuses are more likely to stay in the flood-prone area, to minimize their losses from the flood. If households with management-level employees received real-time and accurate updates about the flood, the decision to evacuate would be freely decided by such households, which can minimize their losses. Similarly, real-time and accurate data about potential damages and losses can reduce moral hazards. Thus, it is necessary for national and local governments to understand area-specific characteristics of people and linkages between societal vulnerability and economic resilience. The study\u2019s implications highlight the importance of developing disaster management strategies in an integrated area-based approach.",

The result of this study helps fill the gap in literature about the factor affecting a house-hold\u2019s decision to evacuate in response to the flood, as such a decision varies with the type of natural disas-ter. The result of the study confirms that more vul-nerable people are less likely to evacuate. However, they are more likely to evacuate, if at least one of their household members has reduced mobility. People in flood-prone areas exhibited moral hazards. Further-more, people with relatively secured employment sta-tuses are more likely to stay in the flood-prone area, to minimize their losses from the flood. If households with management-level employees received real-time and accurate updates about the flood, the decision to evacuate would be freely decided by such households, which can minimize their losses. Similarly, real-time and accurate data about potential damages and losses can reduce moral hazards. Thus, it is necessary for national and local governments to understand area-specific characteristics of people and linkages between societal vulnerability and economic resilience. The study\u2019s implications highlight the importance of developing disaster management strategies in an integrated area-based approach.",
