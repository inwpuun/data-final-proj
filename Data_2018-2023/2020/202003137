Insufficient serum vitamin D is related to risks of cancer incidence, progression and mortality. Objective: To analyze vitamin D status with anthropometric, biochemical and tumor markers at the first cancer diagnosis among Thai cancer patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 106 patient's medical records at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The body mass index as an anthropometric marker, biomarkers included diabetes status, hematological parameters, albumin level, lipid profiles, kidney and liver functions, C-reactive protein, and tumor markers were recorded. Level of serum circulating vitamin D was categorized into three groups: 1) vitamin D deficiency, <20 ng/mL; 2) insufficiency, 20 to 30 ng/mL; 3) sufficiency, >30 ng/mL. All parameters were analyzed using SPSS with the significance level of p-value at 0.05. Results: The results revealed that the prevalence of serum circulating vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency were 49%, 49%, and 2% respectively. Interestingly, colon cancer patients showed significantly lower mean serum circulating vitamin D which was 17.4 ng/mL, while the mean serum circulating vitamin D level of the other cancer group was 20.3 ng/mL with p-value of 0.036. Additionally, five markers including BMI, diabetes, low Hb, low Hct, and high ALP levels showed significantly low serum circulating vitamin D when compared to normal reference range group. Conclusion: The present study strongly revealed that 98% of cancer patients had low serum circulating vitamin D levels and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 49% which commonly found in colon cancer patients. This finding suggests that vitamin D deficiency is an important indicator related to colon cancer prognosis.",

Insufficient serum vitamin D is related to risks of cancer incidence, progression and mortality. Objective: To analyze vitamin D status with anthropometric, biochemical and tumor markers at the first cancer diagnosis among Thai cancer patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 106 patient's medical records at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The body mass index as an anthropometric marker, biomarkers included diabetes status, hematological parameters, albumin level, lipid profiles, kidney and liver functions, C-reactive protein, and tumor markers were recorded. Level of serum circulating vitamin D was categorized into three groups: 1) vitamin D deficiency, <20 ng/mL; 2) insufficiency, 20 to 30 ng/mL; 3) sufficiency, >30 ng/mL. All parameters were analyzed using SPSS with the significance level of p-value at 0.05. Results: The results revealed that the prevalence of serum circulating vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency were 49%, 49%, and 2% respectively. Interestingly, colon cancer patients showed significantly lower mean serum circulating vitamin D which was 17.4 ng/mL, while the mean serum circulating vitamin D level of the other cancer group was 20.3 ng/mL with p-value of 0.036. Additionally, five markers including BMI, diabetes, low Hb, low Hct, and high ALP levels showed significantly low serum circulating vitamin D when compared to normal reference range group. Conclusion: The present study strongly revealed that 98% of cancer patients had low serum circulating vitamin D levels and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 49% which commonly found in colon cancer patients. This finding suggests that vitamin D deficiency is an important indicator related to colon cancer prognosis.",
