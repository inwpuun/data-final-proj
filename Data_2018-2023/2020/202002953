                "abstracts": "© 15th International Symposium on East Asian Resources Recycling Technology, EARTH 2019. All rights reserved.Electricity generation from solar PV Cell has become more and more popular resulting to remarkable increasing of wastes from end-of-life solar PV cell. Meanwhile, silicon used to produce solar PV cell is quite high purity (or high valuable) and requires highly processed with high energy and chemicals consumption. The silicon is sourced from silica mines while the resources having high quartz concentration is depleting, and also many materials used to produce solar panels can be hazardous. Hence, recovery of silicon from the end-of-life solar PV cell is a sustainable way to reduce resources consumption as well as environmental and health impacts. The end-of-life solar PV cell used in present study is a product of Singapore Co., Ltd produced in 2014. The mass composition of which is glass (73-75%), plastic (5-6%), silicon (4-5%), aluminium (3-4%), excluding aluminium frame (15%), and some other elements (less than 1% including silver, copper, and trace elements). After grinding into fine grain to provide particles liberation in various sizes (#70, #100, #150, #200 mesh, and Pan), each sample was tested with shaking table with incline angle of 5 degree, 7.5 degree, and 10 degree, and tested by JIG at stoke length of 5 cm, 10 cm and 15 cm, respectively. The results show maximum separation efficiency of 26.26% Si recovery with 1.98% grade for the shaking table with 10 degree incline angle, and 24.13% Si recovery with 2.72% grade for the JIG separation at 5 cm stoke length. Meanwhile, the separation by froth flotation shows the very much higher efficiency with 56.93% Si recovery with 72.49% grade (@particle size retained #100 mesh and HF 8 cc/l to achieve pH 3). Therefore, the wet separation process by froth flotation would be considered as an effective method to recovery silicon end-of-life solar PV cell.",

        "dc:description": "Electricity generation from solar PV Cell has become more and more popular resulting to remarkable increasing of wastes from end-of-life solar PV cell. Meanwhile, silicon used to produce solar PV cell is quite high purity (or high valuable) and requires highly processed with high energy and chemicals consumption. The silicon is sourced from silica mines while the resources having high quartz concentration is depleting, and also many materials used to produce solar panels can be hazardous. Hence, recovery of silicon from the end-of-life solar PV cell is a sustainable way to reduce resources consumption as well as environmental and health impacts. The end-of-life solar PV cell used in present study is a product of Singapore Co., Ltd produced in 2014. The mass composition of which is glass (73-75%), plastic (5-6%), silicon (4-5%), aluminium (3-4%), excluding aluminium frame (15%), and some other elements (less than 1% including silver, copper, and trace elements). After grinding into fine grain to provide particles liberation in various sizes (#70, #100, #150, #200 mesh, and Pan), each sample was tested with shaking table with incline angle of 5 degree, 7.5 degree, and 10 degree, and tested by JIG at stoke length of 5 cm, 10 cm and 15 cm, respectively. The results show maximum separation efficiency of 26.26% Si recovery with 1.98% grade for the shaking table with 10 degree incline angle, and 24.13% Si recovery with 2.72% grade for the JIG separation at 5 cm stoke length. Meanwhile, the separation by froth flotation shows the very much higher efficiency with 56.93% Si recovery with 72.49% grade (@particle size retained #100 mesh and HF 8 cc/l to achieve pH 3). Therefore, the wet separation process by froth flotation would be considered as an effective method to recovery silicon end-of-life solar PV cell.",
