                "abstracts": "© 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research. All rights reserved.Background/Aim: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process that facilitates cancer metastasis. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that target EMT have garnered increasing attention. The present study aimed to examine the in vitro effects of ephemeranthol A on cell death, migration, and EMT of lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Ephemeranthol A was isolated from Dendrobium infundibulum. Non-small cell lung cancer cells H460 were treated with ephemeranthol A and apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining. Anoikis resistance was determined by soft agar assay. Wound healing assay was performed to test the migration. The regulatory proteins of apoptosis and cell motility were determined by western blot. Results: Treatment with ephemeranthol A resulted in a concentration-dependent cell apoptosis. At non-toxic concentrations, the compound could inhibit anchorage-independent growth of the cancer cells, as indicated by the decreased colony size and number. Ephemeranthol A also exhibited an inhibitory effect on migration. We further found that ephemeranthol A exerts its antimetastatic effects via inhibition of EMT, as indicated by the markedly decrease of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug. Furthermore, the compound suppressed the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (Akt) proteins, which are key regulators of cell migration. As for the anticancer activity, ephemeranthol A induced apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 followed by the activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9. Conclusion: The pro-apoptotic and anti-migratory effects of ephemeranthol A on human lung cancer cells support its use for the development of novel anticancer therapies.",

        "dc:description": "Background/Aim: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process that facilitates cancer metastasis. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that target EMT have garnered increasing attention. The present study aimed to examine the in vitro effects of ephemeranthol A on cell death, migration, and EMT of lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Ephemeranthol A was isolated from Dendrobium infundibulum. Non-small cell lung cancer cells H460 were treated with ephemeranthol A and apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining. Anoikis resistance was determined by soft agar assay. Wound healing assay was performed to test the migration. The regulatory proteins of apoptosis and cell motility were determined by western blot. Results: Treatment with ephemeranthol A resulted in a concentration-dependent cell apoptosis. At non-toxic concentrations, the compound could inhibit anchorage-independent growth of the cancer cells, as indicated by the decreased colony size and number. Ephemeranthol A also exhibited an inhibitory effect on migration. We further found that ephemeranthol A exerts its antimetastatic effects via inhibition of EMT, as indicated by the markedly decrease of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug. Furthermore, the compound suppressed the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and protein kinase B (Akt) proteins, which are key regulators of cell migration. As for the anticancer activity, ephemeranthol A induced apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 followed by the activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9. Conclusion: The pro-apoptotic and anti-migratory effects of ephemeranthol A on human lung cancer cells support its use for the development of novel anticancer therapies.",
