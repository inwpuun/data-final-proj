                "abstracts": "© 2020 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.Background and Aim: Cardiac fibroblasts are important for both normal and pathological states of the heart, but the knowledge in cell physiology and genomics is still poorly understood. The aims of the present study were; first, to investigate the expression of cardiac and fibrotic genes in rat cardiac fibroblasts compared to cardiomyocytes and other fibroblasts (skin and muscle fibroblasts), second, to examine the in vitro effect of serum concentration on fibroblast gene expression. The findings can potentially be applied in ischemia/reperfusion models. Materials and Methods: Rat cardiac fibroblasts were collected and cultured in different conditions, and their gene expression (21 cardiogenic genes and 16 fibrotic genes) was compared with cardiomyocytes and other fibroblasts using comparative quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We also mimicked myocardial ischemia/reperfusion by depleting and then adding a serum into the culture in conventional culture (10% serum). Results: Cardiac fibroblasts expressed most of the cardiogenic genes, but their expression levels were significantly lower than in cardiomyocytes, while almost all fibrotic genes in the cardiac fibroblasts were significantly more highly expressed than in cardiomyocytes, except matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9) which also had greater expression in other fibroblasts. After mimicking cardiac ischemia and reperfusion in vitro by starving and then adding a serum into the cardiac fibroblast culture, the results revealed that Mmp9 expression was significantly increased (>30 times) after increasing but not reducing the serum in the culture. The expression of most cardiogenic and fibrotic genes in cardiac fibroblasts tended to decrease after increasing the serum in the culture. These changes were specific to cardiac fibroblasts but no other fibroblasts. Conclusion: Cardiac fibroblasts have a distinct pattern of gene expression from other fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. They are also sensitive to high serum concentration but not affected by serum depletion, suggesting that the process of developing cardiac fibrosis might be stimulated by reperfusion or overcirculation rather than ischemia. The cell starvation followed the adding of serum may serve as a useful model to study cardiac fibrosis cause by the change of blood flow.",

        "dc:description": "Background and Aim: Cardiac fibroblasts are important for both normal and pathological states of the heart, but the knowledge in cell physiology and genomics is still poorly understood. The aims of the present study were; first, to investigate the expression of cardiac and fibrotic genes in rat cardiac fibroblasts compared to cardiomyocytes and other fibroblasts (skin and muscle fibroblasts), second, to examine the in vitro effect of serum concentration on fibroblast gene expression. The findings can potentially be applied in ischemia/reperfusion models. Materials and Methods: Rat cardiac fibroblasts were collected and cultured in different conditions, and their gene expression (21 cardiogenic genes and 16 fibrotic genes) was compared with cardiomyocytes and other fibroblasts using comparative quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We also mimicked myocardial ischemia/reperfusion by depleting and then adding a serum into the culture in conventional culture (10% serum). Results: Cardiac fibroblasts expressed most of the cardiogenic genes, but their expression levels were significantly lower than in cardiomyocytes, while almost all fibrotic genes in the cardiac fibroblasts were significantly more highly expressed than in cardiomyocytes, except matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9) which also had greater expression in other fibroblasts. After mimicking cardiac ischemia and reperfusion in vitro by starving and then adding a serum into the cardiac fibroblast culture, the results revealed that Mmp9 expression was significantly increased (>30 times) after increasing but not reducing the serum in the culture. The expression of most cardiogenic and fibrotic genes in cardiac fibroblasts tended to decrease after increasing the serum in the culture. These changes were specific to cardiac fibroblasts but no other fibroblasts. Conclusion: Cardiac fibroblasts have a distinct pattern of gene expression from other fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. They are also sensitive to high serum concentration but not affected by serum depletion, suggesting that the process of developing cardiac fibrosis might be stimulated by reperfusion or overcirculation rather than ischemia. The cell starvation followed the adding of serum may serve as a useful model to study cardiac fibrosis cause by the change of blood flow.",
