All rights reserved.The objectives of this research were (1) to investigate the levels of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Zn in the breast milk of lactating mothers who working in industrial area (2) to investigate associated factors related with heavy metals in breast milk. 44 breast milk samples were analyzed by ICP-MS, the average Cd was 0.31+1.42 µg/L, Cr was 14.06+46.81 µg/L, Cu was 9.99+4.59 µg/L, Pb was 8.64+18.67 µg/L, Mn was 7.18+25.72 µg/L, Zn was 16.06+10.33 µg/L. Chi square presented that Cr, Pb, Mn was associated with period of work experience, Cr, Mn, Zn was associated with green leafy vegetable consumption (p<0.05). Binary logistic regression presented positively significant association between Pb in breast milk of factory workers and working in factory experience (95%CI was 1.085-38.699), and also showed positive significant relationship between Cu in breast milk and working hours per week of factory workers (95%CI was 1.019-14.758). Thus this study can serve as a representative of heavy metals exposure of lactating mothers and also provide the database of heavy metals in breast milk of industrial factory workers.",

Chi square presented that Cr, Pb, Mn was associated with period of work experience, Cr, Mn, Zn was associated with green leafy vegetable consumption (p<0.05). Binary logistic regression presented positively significant association between Pb in breast milk of factory workers and working in factory experience (95%CI was 1.085-38.699), and also showed positive significant relationship between Cu in breast milk and working hours per week of factory workers (95%CI was 1.019-14.758). Thus this study can serve as a representative of heavy metals exposure of lactating mothers and also provide the database of heavy metals in breast milk of industrial factory workers.",
