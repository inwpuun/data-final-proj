This study was conducted to describe characteristics of infections occurring before the initiation of immunosuppressants in hospitalized children with newly diagnosed SLE in underresourced areas. Methods: Medical records of paediatric patients with the diagnosis of SLE, who were admitted to a university-based hospital from 2002 to 2018, were reviewed. Only patients younger than 18 years of age with newly diagnosed SLE were included in the study. The primary outcome was infection before the administration of immunosuppressants. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with infection and adjusted odds ratio (OR). The diagnostic accuracy of CRP was assessed. Results: Infections were confirmed in 52/124 (41.9%) children. Pathogens were identified in 24 (46.2%) patients with bacterial predominance. The most common site was respiratory infections (36.5%). Fever and serosal involvement were more prevalent in patients with infection. Serum CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with infection than in those without infection (median 5.5 mg/L (interquartile range (IQR) 3.6\u201376.3 mg/L) vs. 3.5 mg/L (IQR 3.0\u20133.6 mg/L), p = 0.004). When a positive CRP level of >5 mg/L was used, positive CRP was found with a higher prevalence in patients with infection and was independently associated with infection (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 28.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3\u2013350.6; p = 0.009). Patients with infection had a longer hospital stay than patients without infection (median 20 days (IQR 13\u201325 days) vs. 15 days (IQR 9\u201324 days), p = 0.04). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value with 95% CI of CRP >5 mg/L were 62.5% (35.4\u201384.8%), 88.9% (65.3\u201398.6%), 80.3% (51.0\u201394.1%) and 76.6% (63.1\u201386.3%), respectively. Conclusions: Infections were common among hospitalized children with newly diagnosed SLE. Children with infections had a prolonged course of hospitalization. Positive CRP was associated with a predisposition towards infection. However, the diagnostic accuracy of CRP requires further validation in a larger study.",

This study was conducted to describe characteristics of infections occurring before the initiation of immunosuppressants in hospitalized children with newly diagnosed SLE in underresourced areas. Methods: Medical records of paediatric patients with the diagnosis of SLE, who were admitted to a university-based hospital from 2002 to 2018, were reviewed. Only patients younger than 18 years of age with newly diagnosed SLE were included in the study. The primary outcome was infection before the administration of immunosuppressants. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with infection and adjusted odds ratio (OR). The diagnostic accuracy of CRP was assessed. Results: Infections were confirmed in 52/124 (41.9%) children. Pathogens were identified in 24 (46.2%) patients with bacterial predominance. The most common site was respiratory infections (36.5%). Fever and serosal involvement were more prevalent in patients with infection. Serum CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with infection than in those without infection (median 5.5 mg/L (interquartile range (IQR) 3.6\u201376.3 mg/L) vs. 3.5 mg/L (IQR 3.0\u20133.6 mg/L), p = 0.004). When a positive CRP level of >5 mg/L was used, positive CRP was found with a higher prevalence in patients with infection and was independently associated with infection (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 28.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3\u2013350.6; p = 0.009). Patients with infection had a longer hospital stay than patients without infection (median 20 days (IQR 13\u201325 days) vs. 15 days (IQR 9\u201324 days), p = 0.04). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value with 95% CI of CRP >5 mg/L were 62.5% (35.4\u201384.8%), 88.9% (65.3\u201398.6%), 80.3% (51.0\u201394.1%) and 76.6% (63.1\u201386.3%), respectively. Conclusions: Infections were common among hospitalized children with newly diagnosed SLE. Children with infections had a prolonged course of hospitalization. Positive CRP was associated with a predisposition towards infection. However, the diagnostic accuracy of CRP requires further validation in a larger study.",
