                "abstracts": "© 2020, McFarland and Company, Inc. All rights reserved.Purpose\u2014This paper examines how economic sanctions imposed on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) by the United Nations and the United States, which has taken additional measures to ban DPRK\u2019s economic activities in order to pressure the regime into denuclearization, may have an adverse effect on the prospect of reunification in the Korean Peninsula. Design/Methodology/Approach\u2014A critical evaluation of the current situation in the Peninsula through rational choice perspective. This paper proposes a solution that may promote the future of reunification in accordance with the modernization theory of democratization. Findings\u2014This paper finds that economic sanctions can discourage the prospect of reunification for two main reasons: (1) sanctions put strains on the DPRK\u2019s economy, but not enough for the regime to surrender its nuclear weapons; and (2) UN sanctions have intrinsic monitoring and implementation issues. Practical Implications\u2014The findings from this paper might be useful for policymakers as an alternative outlook on the issue of reunification; and thus, might reshape the approach to negotiation. Originality/Value\u2014This paper offers an alternative perspective about economic sanctions, which are one of the most used instruments of coercion/manipulation in the realm of international relations. Moreover, it also offers a more good- natured approach to reunification.",

Design/Methodology/Approach\u2014A critical evaluation of the current situation in the Peninsula through rational choice perspective. This paper proposes a solution that may promote the future of reunification in accordance with the modernization theory of democratization. Findings\u2014This paper finds that economic sanctions can discourage the prospect of reunification for two main reasons: (1) sanctions put strains on the DPRK\u2019s economy, but not enough for the regime to surrender its nuclear weapons; and (2) UN sanctions have intrinsic monitoring and implementation issues. Practical Implications\u2014The findings from this paper might be useful for policymakers as an alternative outlook on the issue of reunification; and thus, might reshape the approach to negotiation. Originality/Value\u2014This paper offers an alternative perspective about economic sanctions, which are one of the most used instruments of coercion/manipulation in the realm of international relations. Moreover, it also offers a more good- natured approach to reunification.",
