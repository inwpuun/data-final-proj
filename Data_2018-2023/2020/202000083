                "abstracts": "© School of Engineering, Taylor\u2019s UniversityCement clay interlocking (CCI) bricks are frequently used for the construction of residential and low-rise commercial buildings in many developing countries. The salient features of these bricks are low price, low weight and required less use of cement mortar during construction. In the past many studies have been published on axial compression of CCI brick walls. This study aims to investigate the lateral cyclic response of CCI brick masonry walls under earthquake loading. To achieve this, a comprehensive experimental program was established in which a total number of six large-scale CCI brick masonry walls were constructed and tested under lateral cyclic loading. Different types of walls such as solid walls and walls with window openings were constructed and tested. In addition, different construction methods such as dry stacking, use of cement sand grout and steel bars were exercised to evaluate their efficiency on strength and ductility of the CCI hollow brick masonry walls. The experimental results indicate that dry stacking method is very vulnerable against lateral loading. Use of cement sand grout and steel bars is found very effective to enhance strength of CCI brick masonry walls. The damage pattern of the CCI hollow brick masonry walls with openings is observed very destructive as compared with solid walls (walls without openings).",

        "dc:description": "Cement clay interlocking (CCI) bricks are frequently used for the construction of residential and low-rise commercial buildings in many developing countries. The salient features of these bricks are low price, low weight and required less use of cement mortar during construction. In the past many studies have been published on axial compression of CCI brick walls. This study aims to investigate the lateral cyclic response of CCI brick masonry walls under earthquake loading. To achieve this, a comprehensive experimental program was established in which a total number of six large-scale CCI brick masonry walls were constructed and tested under lateral cyclic loading. Different types of walls such as solid walls and walls with window openings were constructed and tested. In addition, different construction methods such as dry stacking, use of cement sand grout and steel bars were exercised to evaluate their efficiency on strength and ductility of the CCI hollow brick masonry walls. The experimental results indicate that dry stacking method is very vulnerable against lateral loading. Use of cement sand grout and steel bars is found very effective to enhance strength of CCI brick masonry walls. The damage pattern of the CCI hollow brick masonry walls with openings is observed very destructive as compared with solid walls (walls without openings).",
