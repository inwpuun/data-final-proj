                "abstracts": "© 2020 by the authors.During 29-31 September 2019, tropical storm Podul moved into the Kaeng Lawa sub-watershed (KLs), the upstream area of the Chi watershed, causing the worst flooding in 40 years. This study was carried out to analyze the watershed characteristic (WC) variables and prioritize the risks of land-use patterns in KLs, Khon Kaen Province, using a watershed delineation approach. As a result of this study, of the 11 sub-watersheds in the Kaeng Lawa watershed, only KL03 and KL04 were deemed medium priority within their drainage and storage capacity systems. KL01, in the upstream sub-watershed, displayed very low priority. The pattern of land-use that appeared most in KL01 sub-watershed was deforestation, where the upper forest area appeared to show a 63% decrease from 2002 to 2017. The decreased forest area was replaced with agricultural area, for crops such as sugarcane and para-rubber, and fruit farms. Moreover, increases in urban area expansion were found in the downstream area in the north of KLs. The findings of this study reveal that severe flooding in this area was caused not only by tropical storm Podul, but also by the low prioritization of watershed characteristics and patterns of land-use that resulted in decreasing forested area in this watershed area. Consequently, these factors have influenced watershed storage and caused an accumulation of water volume, which regularly results in floods. Thus, flood mitigation should be implemented urgently, in the very low priority areas of the study area first.",

        "dc:description": "During 29-31 September 2019, tropical storm Podul moved into the Kaeng Lawa sub-watershed (KLs), the upstream area of the Chi watershed, causing the worst flooding in 40 years. This study was carried out to analyze the watershed characteristic (WC) variables and prioritize the risks of land-use patterns in KLs, Khon Kaen Province, using a watershed delineation approach. As a result of this study, of the 11 sub-watersheds in the Kaeng Lawa watershed, only KL03 and KL04 were deemed medium priority within their drainage and storage capacity systems. KL01, in the upstream sub-watershed, displayed very low priority. The pattern of land-use that appeared most in KL01 sub-watershed was deforestation, where the upper forest area appeared to show a 63% decrease from 2002 to 2017. The decreased forest area was replaced with agricultural area, for crops such as sugarcane and para-rubber, and fruit farms. Moreover, increases in urban area expansion were found in the downstream area in the north of KLs. The findings of this study reveal that severe flooding in this area was caused not only by tropical storm Podul, but also by the low prioritization of watershed characteristics and patterns of land-use that resulted in decreasing forested area in this watershed area. Consequently, these factors have influenced watershed storage and caused an accumulation of water volume, which regularly results in floods. Thus, flood mitigation should be implemented urgently, in the very low priority areas of the study area first.",
