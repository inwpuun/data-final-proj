                {"$": "All HD staff should attend infection control refresher training at least once every 24 months. In mainland China, routine nurse training programs are provided twice per year, and nurses from satellite units meet in central cities for lectures on infection control measures. Taiwan has yearly continuing medical education programs, and the renal society offers accreditation (funded by insurance). In Korea, infection control guidelines from the Korean Society of Nephrology are implemented. HD quality practices, including screening for anti-HCV antibodies, are assessed annually by a national health insurance review. In Singapore, all new staff members review written protocols for infection control and subsequently are tested on their knowledge of the material. Clinical practice improvement projects such as Rapid Improvement Events (RIEs) are used to identify shortfalls and implement continuous quality improvement initiatives. In cases of lapses, corrective measures are taken. In Malaysia, infection control measures are covered in national HD quality standards, and nephrologists and senior paramedics lead annual refresher courses on infection control in dialysis. In Thailand, staff must be accredited (i.e., have received training for 6 months, plus have 4 years of experience in HD centers, with a minimum of 1000 HD sessions to qualify for a state license examination) prior to working in dialysis units, with infection control a part of the curriculum. Refresher courses are required annually."}

The guideline synthesized recent advances, especially in HCV therapeutics and diagnostics, and provided clinical recommendations and suggestions to aid healthcare providers and improve care for CKD patients with HCV. To gain insight into the extent that the 2018 guideline has been adopted in Asia, KDIGO convened an HCV Implementation Summit in Hong Kong. Participants included nephrologists, hepatologists, and nurse consultants from 8 Southeast Asian countries or regions with comparable high-to-middle economic ranking by the World Bank: mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Through presentations and discussions, meeting participants described regional practice patterns related to the KDIGO HCV in CKD guideline, identified barriers to implementing the guideline, and developed strategies for overcoming the barriers in Asia and around the world.",

        "dc:description": "In 2018, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a clinical practice guideline on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The guideline synthesized recent advances, especially in HCV therapeutics and diagnostics, and provided clinical recommendations and suggestions to aid healthcare providers and improve care for CKD patients with HCV. To gain insight into the extent that the 2018 guideline has been adopted in Asia, KDIGO convened an HCV Implementation Summit in Hong Kong. Participants included nephrologists, hepatologists, and nurse consultants from 8 Southeast Asian countries or regions with comparable high-to-middle economic ranking by the World Bank: mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Through presentations and discussions, meeting participants described regional practice patterns related to the KDIGO HCV in CKD guideline, identified barriers to implementing the guideline, and developed strategies for overcoming the barriers in Asia and around the world.",
