                "abstracts": "© 2019 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan UniversityBackground and aim: Lignosus rhinocerus (LR) is an edible mushroom with a variety of medicinal properties such as neurostimulation, immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-proliferation, anti-diabetes and especially antiviral activity. Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) needs the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) for its replication. Therefore, both HIV-1 PR and RT are important targets for antiretroviral drug development. Experimental procedure: The crude hexane (LRH), ethanol (LRE) and water (LRW) extracts of LR were in vitro screened for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 PR and RT, then anti-HIV-1 activity on the infected MOLT-4 cells were determined. Chemical constituents of the extracts were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. The identified compounds were in silico analysed for drug-likeness property and molecular modelling. Results and conclusion: According to our screening assays, LRE and LRW significantly inhibited both enzymes (25\u201355%), while LRH suppressed only the HIV-1 PR activity (88.97%). At 0.5 mg/ml of LRW showed significant inhibition of HIV-1 induced syncytial formation and p24 production in the infected MOLT-4 cells. Investigation of chemical analysis revealed that major groups of identified constituents found in the extracts were fatty acids, peptides and terpenoids. In silico analysis showed that heliantriol F and 6 alpha-fluoroprogesterone displayed great binding energies with HIV-1 PR and HIV-1 RT, respectively. These findings suggest that LR could be a potential source of compounds to inhibit HIV-1 PR and/or RT activities in vitro. Furthermore, our results provide beneficial data for the development of novel HIV-1 PR and RT inhibitors.",

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) needs the HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) for its replication. Therefore, both HIV-1 PR and RT are important targets for antiretroviral drug development. Experimental procedure: The crude hexane (LRH), ethanol (LRE) and water (LRW) extracts of LR were in vitro screened for inhibitory activity against HIV-1 PR and RT, then anti-HIV-1 activity on the infected MOLT-4 cells were determined. Chemical constituents of the extracts were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. The identified compounds were in silico analysed for drug-likeness property and molecular modelling. Results and conclusion: According to our screening assays, LRE and LRW significantly inhibited both enzymes (25\u201355%), while LRH suppressed only the HIV-1 PR activity (88.97%). At 0.5 mg/ml of LRW showed significant inhibition of HIV-1 induced syncytial formation and p24 production in the infected MOLT-4 cells. Investigation of chemical analysis revealed that major groups of identified constituents found in the extracts were fatty acids, peptides and terpenoids. In silico analysis showed that heliantriol F and 6 alpha-fluoroprogesterone displayed great binding energies with HIV-1 PR and HIV-1 RT, respectively. These findings suggest that LR could be a potential source of compounds to inhibit HIV-1 PR and/or RT activities in vitro. Furthermore, our results provide beneficial data for the development of novel HIV-1 PR and RT inhibitors.",
