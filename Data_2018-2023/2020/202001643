Based on a literature review utilizing Medline, Cochrane library, and Embase databases, first draft clinical questions (CQs) were developed by a planning panel (HI, RR, HPW, IY, YN, and HK). These first draft CQs were discussed via the internet and revised by each author. A face-to-face meeting was conducted in June 2017 in Tokyo, Japan. After further discussion and revision, the statements were voted on by all attendees (YN, HI, HPW, RR, CK, IY, HK, JHM, JL, SL, TR, DWS, DKL, DM, FD, WL, PVD, MA, AI, AK, MK, SR, and TF). The evidence level and recommendation grade were evaluated using the evidence leveling system (Table). The discussion continued until an agreement of greater than 80% was achieved for recommendation Level A or B. Finally, after voting, a total of 19 consensus statements were agreed upon..",

Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology published by Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdDistal biliary strictures (DBS) are common and may be caused by both malignant and benign pathologies. While endoscopic procedures play a major role in their management, a comprehensive review of the subject is still lacking. Our consensus statements were formulated by a group of expert Asian pancreatico-biliary interventional endoscopists, following a proposal from the Digestive Endoscopy Society of Taiwan, the Thai Association for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and the Tokyo Conference of Asian Pancreato-biliary Interventional Endoscopy. Based on a literature review utilizing Medline, Cochrane library, and Embase databases, a total of 19 consensus statements on DBS were made on diagnosis, endoscopic drainage, benign biliary stricture, malignant biliary stricture, and management of recurrent biliary obstruction and other complications. Our consensus statements provide comprehensive guidance for the endoscopic management of DBS.",

Based on a literature review utilizing Medline, Cochrane library, and Embase databases, first draft clinical questions (CQs) were developed by a planning panel (HI, RR, HPW, IY, YN, and HK). These first draft CQs were discussed via the internet and revised by each author. A face-to-face meeting was conducted in June 2017 in Tokyo, Japan. After further discussion and revision, the statements were voted on by all attendees (YN, HI, HPW, RR, CK, IY, HK, JHM, JL, SL, TR, DWS, DKL, DM, FD, WL, PVD, MA, AI, AK, MK, SR, and TF). The evidence level and recommendation grade were evaluated using the evidence leveling system (Table).

While endoscopic procedures play a major role in their management, a comprehensive review of the subject is still lacking. Our consensus statements were formulated by a group of expert Asian pancreatico-biliary interventional endoscopists, following a proposal from the Digestive Endoscopy Society of Taiwan, the Thai Association for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and the Tokyo Conference of Asian Pancreato-biliary Interventional Endoscopy. Based on a literature review utilizing Medline, Cochrane library, and Embase databases, a total of 19 consensus statements on DBS were made on diagnosis, endoscopic drainage, benign biliary stricture, malignant biliary stricture, and management of recurrent biliary obstruction and other complications. Our consensus statements provide comprehensive guidance for the endoscopic management of DBS.",
