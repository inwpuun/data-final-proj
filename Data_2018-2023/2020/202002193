Countries are responding to the challenge of end-stage kidney disease in different ways, with variable provision of the components of a kidney care strategy, including effective prevention, detection, conservative care, kidney transplantation, and an appropriate mix of dialysis modalities. This collection of case studies is from 15 countries from around the world and offers valuable learning examples from a variety of contexts. The variability in approaches may be explained by country differences in burden of disease, available human or financial resources, income status, and cost structures. In addition, cultural considerations, political context, and competing interests from other stakeholders must be considered. Although the approaches taken have often varied substantially, a common theme is the potential benefits of multistakeholder engagement aimed at improving the availability and scope of integrated kidney care.",

        "dc:description": "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors is increasing worldwide, and the rapid rise in global need for end-stage kidney disease care is a major challenge for health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Countries are responding to the challenge of end-stage kidney disease in different ways, with variable provision of the components of a kidney care strategy, including effective prevention, detection, conservative care, kidney transplantation, and an appropriate mix of dialysis modalities. This collection of case studies is from 15 countries from around the world and offers valuable learning examples from a variety of contexts. The variability in approaches may be explained by country differences in burden of disease, available human or financial resources, income status, and cost structures. In addition, cultural considerations, political context, and competing interests from other stakeholders must be considered. Although the approaches taken have often varied substantially, a common theme is the potential benefits of multistakeholder engagement aimed at improving the availability and scope of integrated kidney care.",
