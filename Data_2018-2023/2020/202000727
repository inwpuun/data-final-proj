                "abstracts": "© 2020, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.Telomere length is a hallmark characteristic of ageing and age-related diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of joint pain and physical disability in the elderly. Previous studies have revealed the role of telomere shortening in OA; however, the relationship between telomere length, muscle strength and physical performance in knee OA patients remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of telomere length and physical performance in patients with knee OA. A total of 202 patients with knee OA and 60 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The quality of life was assessed using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and Short Form Health Survey. The skeletal muscle mass was examined using bioelectrical impedance analysis, while the muscle strength was analyzed using hand grip force and isometric knee extension force. The physical performance of patients with knee OA was also investigated using gait speed, Timed up and go test (TUGT), Sit to stand test and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Blood leukocyte relative telomere length (RTL) was assessed using real time quantitative PCR. The mean blood leukocyte RTL in knee OA subjects was significantly lower compared with healthy controls (P<0.001). Knee OA patients with RTL values in the lowest quartile had a slow gait speed (P=0.006) and prolonged TUGT time (P=0.03). Multivariate regression analyses and multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, fat mass, skeletal muscle index and the total WOMAC demon-strated that gait speed, TUGT and 6MWT were associated with longer RTL (P-trend<0.05). These findings suggested that poorer physical performance was associated with shorter RTL. Therefore, leukocyte telomere length and physical performance tests, especially gait speed, TUGT and 6MWT, could predict the health status and quality of life in patients with knee OA.",

        "dc:description": "Telomere length is a hallmark characteristic of ageing and age-related diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of joint pain and physical disability in the elderly. Previous studies have revealed the role of telomere shortening in OA; however, the relationship between telomere length, muscle strength and physical performance in knee OA patients remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of telomere length and physical performance in patients with knee OA. A total of 202 patients with knee OA and 60 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The quality of life was assessed using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and Short Form Health Survey. The skeletal muscle mass was examined using bioelectrical impedance analysis, while the muscle strength was analyzed using hand grip force and isometric knee extension force. The physical performance of patients with knee OA was also investigated using gait speed, Timed up and go test (TUGT), Sit to stand test and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Blood leukocyte relative telomere length (RTL) was assessed using real time quantitative PCR. The mean blood leukocyte RTL in knee OA subjects was significantly lower compared with healthy controls (P<0.001). Knee OA patients with RTL values in the lowest quartile had a slow gait speed (P=0.006) and prolonged TUGT time (P=0.03). Multivariate regression analyses and multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, fat mass, skeletal muscle index and the total WOMAC demon-strated that gait speed, TUGT and 6MWT were associated with longer RTL (P-trend<0.05). These findings suggested that poorer physical performance was associated with shorter RTL. Therefore, leukocyte telomere length and physical performance tests, especially gait speed, TUGT and 6MWT, could predict the health status and quality of life in patients with knee OA.",
