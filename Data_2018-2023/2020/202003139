All rights reserved.Business prosperity is only possible through effective human capital in place and has, therefore, been noted as the key success prospect in the history of management and business. Different studies have indicated towards numerous factors whereby, prominent scholars have outlined an important role of emotional demands, supervisor support and training opportunities. This study aims to explore the influence of emotional demands, supervisor support, and training opportunities on work engagement. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed using a convenient sampling technique. The unit of analysis in this selected the employees of the pharmaceutical companies from any level of the organization, including top-level, medium level and lower level. A total of 355 respondents interviewed form six pharmaceutical companies. After data screening 340 useable questionnaires received and proceeded for further analysis of the study. This study confirm that employees perceive good training opportunities from the organization, they are more engaged at work. The study also found that support from coworkers, more specifically from the supervisor is higher, the employee is obliged to pay back to the organization by engaging more at work. This is the proper implementation of the social exchange theory. The study revealed that emotional support was also a significant predictor of employee engagement in the context of the pharmaceutical industry in Thailand though the effects are comparatively lower than other two factors such as training and supervisor support.",

Different studies have indicated towards numerous factors whereby, prominent scholars have outlined an important role of emotional demands, supervisor support and training opportunities. This study aims to explore the influence of emotional demands, supervisor support, and training opportunities on work engagement. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed using a convenient sampling technique. The unit of analysis in this selected the employees of the pharmaceutical companies from any level of the organization, including top-level, medium level and lower level. A total of 355 respondents interviewed form six pharmaceutical companies. After data screening 340 useable questionnaires received and proceeded for further analysis of the study. This study confirm that employees perceive good training opportunities from the organization, they are more engaged at work. The study also found that support from coworkers, more specifically from the supervisor is higher, the employee is obliged to pay back to the organization by engaging more at work. This is the proper implementation of the social exchange theory. The study revealed that emotional support was also a significant predictor of employee engagement in the context of the pharmaceutical industry in Thailand though the effects are comparatively lower than other two factors such as training and supervisor support.",
