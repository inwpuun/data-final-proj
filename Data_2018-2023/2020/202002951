                "abstracts": "© 15th International Symposium on East Asian Resources Recycling Technology, EARTH 2019. All rights reserved.Green growth economy is one of Thailand's key strategic drivers emphasizing on material recycling moving towards circular economy. Each year nearly 85,000 tons of eggshells, one of wastes overlooked generated by both food industries and households, are left to be disposed of mostly by landfilling. As it is well known that eggshells contain mainly CaCO3, thus the objective of this work aimed to recycle eggshells and use them as a substitution of CaCO3 from limestone. Eggshells were treated and tested for optimum condition such as heating time and temperature to obtain high purity CaCO3 suitable for industrial applications. In this study, eggshells were used as flux for copper sludge smelting comparing with commercial-grade CaCO3. It was found that coarse crushed eggshells gave the best condition for calcination due to the low packing density allowing high air circulation sufficient for burning off organic substances compared with fine crushed ones. By heating at 500̊C for 3 hours, 98-99 wt% of CaCO3 were obtained. In the copper sludge smelting experiment, eggshells treated under different conditions were tested against commercial-grade samples. Eggshells calcined at 500̊C and commercial-grade samples produced similar results of copper recovery from the sludge around 91.5 wt%. However, air-dry eggshells without calcination comprising 94 wt% CaCO3 provided higher copper recovery accounted for 97.6 wt% due to carbon presence in the organic matter acting as a reducing agent converting copper oxides to copper.",

        "dc:description": "Green growth economy is one of Thailand's key strategic drivers emphasizing on material recycling moving towards circular economy. Each year nearly 85,000 tons of eggshells, one of wastes overlooked generated by both food industries and households, are left to be disposed of mostly by landfilling. As it is well known that eggshells contain mainly CaCO3, thus the objective of this work aimed to recycle eggshells and use them as a substitution of CaCO3 from limestone. Eggshells were treated and tested for optimum condition such as heating time and temperature to obtain high purity CaCO3 suitable for industrial applications. In this study, eggshells were used as flux for copper sludge smelting comparing with commercial-grade CaCO3. It was found that coarse crushed eggshells gave the best condition for calcination due to the low packing density allowing high air circulation sufficient for burning off organic substances compared with fine crushed ones. By heating at 500̊C for 3 hours, 98-99 wt% of CaCO3 were obtained. In the copper sludge smelting experiment, eggshells treated under different conditions were tested against commercial-grade samples. Eggshells calcined at 500̊C and commercial-grade samples produced similar results of copper recovery from the sludge around 91.5 wt%. However, air-dry eggshells without calcination comprising 94 wt% CaCO3 provided higher copper recovery accounted for 97.6 wt% due to carbon presence in the organic matter acting as a reducing agent converting copper oxides to copper.",
