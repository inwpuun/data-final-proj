                "abstracts": "© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Schistosoma mekongi is a causative agent of human schistosomiasis. There is limited knowledge of the molecular biology of S. mekongi and very few studies have examined drug targets, vaccine candidates and diagnostic biomarkers for S. mekongi. To explore the biology of S. mekongi, computational as well as experimental approaches were performed on S. mekongi males and females to identify excretory-secretory (ES) proteins and proteins that are differentially expressed between genders. According to bioinformatic prediction, the S. mekongi ES product was approximately 4.7% of total annotated transcriptome sequences. The classical secretory pathway was the main process to secrete proteins. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of male and female adult S. mekongi proteins was performed. We identified 174 and 156 differential expression of proteins in male and female worms, respectively. The dominant male-biased proteins were involved in actin filament-based processes, microtubule-based processes, biosynthetic processes and homeostatic processes. The major female-biased proteins were related to biosynthetic processes, organelle organization and signal transduction. An experimental approach identified 88 proteins in the S. mekongi secretome. The S. mekongi ES proteins mainly contributed to nutrient uptake, essential substance supply and host immune evasion. This research identifies proteins in the S. mekongi secretome and provides information on ES proteins that are differentially expressed between S. mekongi genders. These findings will contribute to S. mekongi drug and vaccine development. In addition, the study enhances our understanding of basic S. mekongi biology.",

        "dc:description": "Schistosoma mekongi is a causative agent of human schistosomiasis. There is limited knowledge of the molecular biology of S. mekongi and very few studies have examined drug targets, vaccine candidates and diagnostic biomarkers for S. mekongi. To explore the biology of S. mekongi, computational as well as experimental approaches were performed on S. mekongi males and females to identify excretory-secretory (ES) proteins and proteins that are differentially expressed between genders. According to bioinformatic prediction, the S. mekongi ES product was approximately 4.7% of total annotated transcriptome sequences. The classical secretory pathway was the main process to secrete proteins. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of male and female adult S. mekongi proteins was performed. We identified 174 and 156 differential expression of proteins in male and female worms, respectively. The dominant male-biased proteins were involved in actin filament-based processes, microtubule-based processes, biosynthetic processes and homeostatic processes. The major female-biased proteins were related to biosynthetic processes, organelle organization and signal transduction. An experimental approach identified 88 proteins in the S. mekongi secretome. The S. mekongi ES proteins mainly contributed to nutrient uptake, essential substance supply and host immune evasion. This research identifies proteins in the S. mekongi secretome and provides information on ES proteins that are differentially expressed between S. mekongi genders. These findings will contribute to S. mekongi drug and vaccine development. In addition, the study enhances our understanding of basic S. mekongi biology.",
