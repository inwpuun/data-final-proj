At the inter-governmental level, the attempt to collaborate for new learning, teaching, and research spaces is in progress in many regions, especially in Europe, Central and Latin America as well as Africa. Besides the needs to use education, especially higher education, to be the driving force in the globalized world for economic growth and to increase regional competitiveness and social cohesion, these common spaces and higher education areas are also designed to meet the needs of the students and to accommodate the new paradigm of education. Politically and economically speaking, a higher education space or area certainly provides some answers to the challenges of higher education development in the globalized world. It directly tackles common problems faced by many countries and HEIs around the world, that is, the problems of access/equity, quality, and participation of key stakeholders in higher education sector. Through the creation of a common space in higher education, an \u2018area\u2019 in which higher education systems in the region share common features could be formed. It is also an area where educational, research, and training activities could be conducted with the same standards or guidelines of assessment, recognition, and quality. It is essentially a \u2018loosely-coordinated and voluntary policy process\u2019 that facilitates far better cooperation in higher education within the region. In a way, it is a search for a common answer to common problems in higher education sector in each region.",

At the inter-governmental level, the attempt to collaborate for new learning, teaching, and research spaces is in progress in many regions, especially in Europe, Central and Latin America as well as Africa. Besides the needs to use education, especially higher education, to be the driving force in the globalized world for economic growth and to increase regional competitiveness and social cohesion, these common spaces and higher education areas are also designed to meet the needs of the students and to accommodate the new paradigm of education. Politically and economically speaking, a higher education space or area certainly provides some answers to the challenges of higher education development in the globalized world. It directly tackles common problems faced by many countries and HEIs around the world, that is, the problems of access/equity, quality, and participation of key stakeholders in higher education sector. Through the creation of a common space in higher education, an \u2018area\u2019 in which higher education systems in the region share common features could be formed. It is also an area where educational, research, and training activities could be conducted with the same standards or guidelines of assessment, recognition, and quality. It is essentially a \u2018loosely-coordinated and voluntary policy process\u2019 that facilitates far better cooperation in higher education within the region. In a way, it is a search for a common answer to common problems in higher education sector in each region.",
