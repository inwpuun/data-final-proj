                "abstracts": "© 2019This research aims to study the influence of EDTA on the accumulation and distribution of Cd in dwarf elephant grass. The research studied concentrations of Cd and EDTA at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L as well as mixtures of Cd and EDTA at molar ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 mol. Plants were analyzed with AAS and LA-ICP-MS every 15 days over a total of 45 days. A Cd concentration of 40 mg/L was used to test the mixtures of Cd and EDTA. A 1:2 molar ratio of Cd and EDTA was found to be the most appropriate for phytoremediation. The plants showed effective growth, low phytotoxicity, and a high accumulation of Cd. The highest Cd accumulation in plants at the end of the experiment was 1,017.39 mg/plant, which accumulated in the underground parts (roots) and aboveground parts (stems and leaves) at 683.70 and 333.69 mg/plant, respectively. LA-ICP-MS analysis showed that Cd accumulation was highest in the underground parts of plants. This result was in accordance with the quantitative data from the AAS. Therefore, it can be concluded that plants mostly accumulate Cd in their underground parts, especially with added EDTA (1:2 mol at 105 days). LA-ICP-MS can be used to conclude with certainty that EDTA is an important factor for effectively inducing Cd into the root system.",

The research studied concentrations of Cd and EDTA at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/L as well as mixtures of Cd and EDTA at molar ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2 mol. Plants were analyzed with AAS and LA-ICP-MS every 15 days over a total of 45 days. A Cd concentration of 40 mg/L was used to test the mixtures of Cd and EDTA. A 1:2 molar ratio of Cd and EDTA was found to be the most appropriate for phytoremediation. The plants showed effective growth, low phytotoxicity, and a high accumulation of Cd. The highest Cd accumulation in plants at the end of the experiment was 1,017.39 mg/plant, which accumulated in the underground parts (roots) and aboveground parts (stems and leaves) at 683.70 and 333.69 mg/plant, respectively. LA-ICP-MS analysis showed that Cd accumulation was highest in the underground parts of plants. This result was in accordance with the quantitative data from the AAS. Therefore, it can be concluded that plants mostly accumulate Cd in their underground parts, especially with added EDTA (1:2 mol at 105 days). LA-ICP-MS can be used to conclude with certainty that EDTA is an important factor for effectively inducing Cd into the root system.",
