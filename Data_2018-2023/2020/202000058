Descriptive statistics were conducted to analyze the micro enterprise communities \u2019 demographic data. While Pearson Product Moment Correlation was employed to analyze the correlation, multiple linear regression analysis was used to find any influence among independent and dependent variables. The current results revealed that both the R&D organizations and the micro enterprises have applied the above four components, which were found to have a correlation and factor analysis to the new product development process. In addition, findings from the questionnaire showed such other new components are Ideation and screening entrepreneur, Matching process for appropriate development, Research and product development and Coordinate product efficiency innovation to commercialization.",
