                "abstracts": "© 2020 ACM.Digital technology has become an important role in organization development. Therefore, it should be aligned with the policy of Thailand Industry 4.0 which helps the country drive forward and is an implementation model for government section, state enterprises, and private section. This policy can help them work efficiently, raise their business value and increase their potential as well as their efficiency of business operation. The case study factory, Security printing business, needs to be researched and be analyzed on an operational plan preparing for Digital transformation. An essential component for the state enterprises in the manufacturing industry is the preparation of automated machinery, digital and innovation technologies with the foundation of a flexible manufacturing system, focusing on the change of working process to Smart Factory. It integrates automated machinery and operators with connected equipment through the network, which covers data collection, controllability, communication, and system operation. So, it prevents the problem of fragmented data in the factory departments when monitoring the status of devices in real-time. This study presents a development plan of machineries and technologies to support digital transformation to apply in organizations such as manufacturing information, machinery integration, security track trace and RFID system to be ready for production and inventory management systems. Furthermore, the factory will be able to support the digital system efficiently as well as to adjust changes in the market in terms of providing fast service and advanced technology to be survived in the future.",

Therefore, it should be aligned with the policy of Thailand Industry 4.0 which helps the country drive forward and is an implementation model for government section, state enterprises, and private section. This policy can help them work efficiently, raise their business value and increase their potential as well as their efficiency of business operation. The case study factory, Security printing business, needs to be researched and be analyzed on an operational plan preparing for Digital transformation. An essential component for the state enterprises in the manufacturing industry is the preparation of automated machinery, digital and innovation technologies with the foundation of a flexible manufacturing system, focusing on the change of working process to Smart Factory. It integrates automated machinery and operators with connected equipment through the network, which covers data collection, controllability, communication, and system operation. So, it prevents the problem of fragmented data in the factory departments when monitoring the status of devices in real-time. This study presents a development plan of machineries and technologies to support digital transformation to apply in organizations such as manufacturing information, machinery integration, security track trace and RFID system to be ready for production and inventory management systems. Furthermore, the factory will be able to support the digital system efficiently as well as to adjust changes in the market in terms of providing fast service and advanced technology to be survived in the future.",
