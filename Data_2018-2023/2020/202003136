Objective: To look for the correlation of TMSE and MoCA scores and develop the conversion table between TMSE and MoCA. Materials and Methods: TMSE and MoCA done on the same day were retrospectively studied. The relationship between TMSE and MoCA was analyzed and a TMSE-MoCA conversion table was developed. Results: There were 183 TMSE and MoCA studies, which were performed in 27 subjects with normal cognitions, 64 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 92 with dementia. Correlation between TMSE and MoCA was analyzed and a TMSE-MoCA conversion table was developed. Using linear regression model, TMSE and MoCA could be presented as the following formula: TMSE = 11.87+0.7 MoCA. Conclusion: In cognitive assessment in subjects with MCI, MoCA was superior to TMSE. The TMSE-MoCA conversion table was developed to facilitate smooth transition between these scores.",

Objective: To look for the correlation of TMSE and MoCA scores and develop the conversion table between TMSE and MoCA. Materials and Methods: TMSE and MoCA done on the same day were retrospectively studied. The relationship between TMSE and MoCA was analyzed and a TMSE-MoCA conversion table was developed. Results: There were 183 TMSE and MoCA studies, which were performed in 27 subjects with normal cognitions, 64 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 92 with dementia. Correlation between TMSE and MoCA was analyzed and a TMSE-MoCA conversion table was developed. Using linear regression model, TMSE and MoCA could be presented as the following formula: TMSE = 11.87+0.7 MoCA. Conclusion: In cognitive assessment in subjects with MCI, MoCA was superior to TMSE. The TMSE-MoCA conversion table was developed to facilitate smooth transition between these scores.",
