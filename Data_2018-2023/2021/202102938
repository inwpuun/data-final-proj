                "abstracts": "© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.Immunopathogenesis has recently emerged as one of the most promising etiological constructs in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Immune abnormalities comprise a range of aberrations which include but are not limited to inflammation and/or immune activation, complement activation, autoimmunity, and antibody-mediated encephalitis. Several soluble immune mediators as well as immuno-competent and immuno-accessory cells are essentially involved in these processes. Amongst these, T lymphocytes have gained increased attention in the genesis of neuropsychiatric disorders owing to their crucial involvement in various neurobiological sequalae, leading to manifestation of psychiatric elements. Besides this, T lymphocytes possess greater functional plasticity and serve as an important bridge among various immune events. T lymphocytes are potentially involved in the induction of inflammation as well as autoimmunity, thereby driving the pathways of many diseases with immune origin. T lymphocytes are shown to regulate key processes of the brain including behavioral responses, neurodevelopment, neurogenesis, cognition, learning, and memory. Deficits in T-cell homeostasis, network, and effector functions alter these processes and contribute substantially towards psychopathology of major psychiatric disorders. Understanding of T lymphocytes homing into the brain, their cross-talk with resident immune cells, like microglia in the brain, and their role in the induction of neuroinflammatory state have made significant contributions to discerning the underlying immunopathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders. There is a growing recognition that T cell-mediated immune activation and/or inflammation drive neuroprogressive changes in major psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, T lymphocytes are also being shown to bear the signatures of antipsychotic medication in patients with psychiatric disorders. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview about the neurobiological relevance of T lymphocytes as well as their expanding roles in the risk and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders and their importance in antipsychotic treatment.",

        "dc:description": "Immunopathogenesis has recently emerged as one of the most promising etiological constructs in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Immune abnormalities comprise a range of aberrations which include but are not limited to inflammation and/or immune activation, complement activation, autoimmunity, and antibody-mediated encephalitis. Several soluble immune mediators as well as immuno-competent and immuno-accessory cells are essentially involved in these processes. Amongst these, T lymphocytes have gained increased attention in the genesis of neuropsychiatric disorders owing to their crucial involvement in various neurobiological sequalae, leading to manifestation of psychiatric elements. Besides this, T lymphocytes possess greater functional plasticity and serve as an important bridge among various immune events. T lymphocytes are potentially involved in the induction of inflammation as well as autoimmunity, thereby driving the pathways of many diseases with immune origin. T lymphocytes are shown to regulate key processes of the brain including behavioral responses, neurodevelopment, neurogenesis, cognition, learning, and memory. Deficits in T-cell homeostasis, network, and effector functions alter these processes and contribute substantially towards psychopathology of major psychiatric disorders. Understanding of T lymphocytes homing into the brain, their cross-talk with resident immune cells, like microglia in the brain, and their role in the induction of neuroinflammatory state have made significant contributions to discerning the underlying immunopathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders. There is a growing recognition that T cell-mediated immune activation and/or inflammation drive neuroprogressive changes in major psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, T lymphocytes are also being shown to bear the signatures of antipsychotic medication in patients with psychiatric disorders. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview about the neurobiological relevance of T lymphocytes as well as their expanding roles in the risk and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders and their importance in antipsychotic treatment.",
