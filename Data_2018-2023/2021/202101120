                "abstracts": "© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Orthognathic surgery and orthodontic treatment are required for patients with dentofacial deformities to obtain an ideal facial esthetic with good functioning. Recently, characterized by the surgery-first approach, an integrated orthodontic\u2013surgical treatment has been introduced as an emerging solution to dentofacial deformity treatment. The surgery-first approach is regarded to have less treatment time and quicker enhancement of a facial profile than the conventional orthodontic\u2013 surgical treatment. Moreover, the recent advances in computing and imaging have allowed the adoption of 3-dimensional (3D) virtual planning protocols in orthognathic surgery as well as digital orthodontic treatment, which enables a paradigm shift when realizing virtual planning properly. These techniques then allow the surgeon and orthodontist to collaborate, plan, and simulate the dentofacial deformity treatment before performing the whole procedure. Along this line, in this research article, we present an integrated treatment method for the realization of an effective deformity treatment. Specifically, we implemented the integrated 3D technique by combining it with the surgery-first orthognathic approach (SFOA) as a novel treatment method for the patients. The outcomes from the combined treatments of the patients with dentofacial deformity, in practice, have demonstrated that our proposed 3D technique in orthognathics and orthodontics using clear aligner therapy (e.g., Invisalign) can enhance the satisfactory level of the patient since the start of treatment then improve their quality of life. As a result, the combined techniques realize the novel integrated treatment method using 3D technology with the use of 3D imaging and modeling as a promising development trend of dentistry, which fits into the context of Dentistry 4.0 as a key enabler to the concept of sustainable dentistry development.",

        "dc:description": "Orthognathic surgery and orthodontic treatment are required for patients with dentofacial deformities to obtain an ideal facial esthetic with good functioning. Recently, characterized by the surgery-first approach, an integrated orthodontic\u2013surgical treatment has been introduced as an emerging solution to dentofacial deformity treatment. The surgery-first approach is regarded to have less treatment time and quicker enhancement of a facial profile than the conventional orthodontic\u2013 surgical treatment. Moreover, the recent advances in computing and imaging have allowed the adoption of 3-dimensional (3D) virtual planning protocols in orthognathic surgery as well as digital orthodontic treatment, which enables a paradigm shift when realizing virtual planning properly. These techniques then allow the surgeon and orthodontist to collaborate, plan, and simulate the dentofacial deformity treatment before performing the whole procedure. Along this line, in this research article, we present an integrated treatment method for the realization of an effective deformity treatment. Specifically, we implemented the integrated 3D technique by combining it with the surgery-first orthognathic approach (SFOA) as a novel treatment method for the patients. The outcomes from the combined treatments of the patients with dentofacial deformity, in practice, have demonstrated that our proposed 3D technique in orthognathics and orthodontics using clear aligner therapy (e.g., Invisalign) can enhance the satisfactory level of the patient since the start of treatment then improve their quality of life. As a result, the combined techniques realize the novel integrated treatment method using 3D technology with the use of 3D imaging and modeling as a promising development trend of dentistry, which fits into the context of Dentistry 4.0 as a key enabler to the concept of sustainable dentistry development.",
