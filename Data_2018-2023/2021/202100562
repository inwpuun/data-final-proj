                "abstracts": "© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. All rights reservedObjectives: To examine the relationship among Health Technology Assessment (HTA) evidence, regulatory classification and reimbursement of health products using glucosamine as a case study. Data of HTA evidence, regulatory classification and reimbursement of glucosamine from 13 countries were extracted from official government websites and peer-reviewed journal articles. Role and responsibility of HTA in each country along as well as the regulatory approval process and reimbursement status of health products were reviewed. The case of glucosamine was then analysed to explore the regulatory classification, reimbursement and its HTA evidence from past to present. Key findings: For regulatory classification, we found that glucosamine is classified as either medicine (9 from 13 countries) or a dietary supplement (4 from 13 countries) depends on where glucosamine is seeking its market approval. Reimbursement also differs among the countries. We summarized the key factors that could be the cause of these variations. First, the clinical evidence of glucosamine is still in question especially its efficacy and as a results its cost-effectiveness. This evidence is important for policy consideration. Secondly, different level of HTA approach in each healthcare system and country context effect on how HTA evidence is utilized and synthesized. Lastly, company's strategic positioning is the first key stakeholder to decide whether their product would be registered as medicine or dietary supplement. Summary: The variation of HTA evidence in a diverse healthcare system affects regulatory classifications and reimbursement. This can result in different levels of patient access to health products.",

Data of HTA evidence, regulatory classification and reimbursement of glucosamine from 13 countries were extracted from official government websites and peer-reviewed journal articles. Role and responsibility of HTA in each country along as well as the regulatory approval process and reimbursement status of health products were reviewed. The case of glucosamine was then analysed to explore the regulatory classification, reimbursement and its HTA evidence from past to present. Key findings: For regulatory classification, we found that glucosamine is classified as either medicine (9 from 13 countries) or a dietary supplement (4 from 13 countries) depends on where glucosamine is seeking its market approval. Reimbursement also differs among the countries. We summarized the key factors that could be the cause of these variations. First, the clinical evidence of glucosamine is still in question especially its efficacy and as a results its cost-effectiveness. This evidence is important for policy consideration. Secondly, different level of HTA approach in each healthcare system and country context effect on how HTA evidence is utilized and synthesized. Lastly, company's strategic positioning is the first key stakeholder to decide whether their product would be registered as medicine or dietary supplement. Summary: The variation of HTA evidence in a diverse healthcare system affects regulatory classifications and reimbursement. This can result in different levels of patient access to health products.",
