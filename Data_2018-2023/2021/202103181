The results suggested the proposed research model had a good model fit. 67.5% of variance in Thai teachers\u2019 behavioral intentions was significantly associated with attitude towards use, perceived ubiquity value, cognitive teaching belief, and personal innovativeness. Attitude towards using mobile technologies was significantly associated with perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived ubiquity value, and personal innovativeness. Perceived usefulness was significantly influenced by perceived ease of use, peer influence, cognitive teaching belief, and cognitive feedback. In addition, computer self-efficacy and perceived enjoyment significantly influenced Thai teachers\u2019 perception of ease of use.",

The results suggested the proposed research model had a good model fit. 67.5% of variance in Thai teachers\u2019 behavioral intentions was significantly associated with attitude towards use, perceived ubiquity value, cognitive teaching belief, and personal innovativeness. Attitude towards using mobile technologies was significantly associated with perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived ubiquity value, and personal innovativeness. Perceived usefulness was significantly influenced by perceived ease of use, peer influence, cognitive teaching belief, and cognitive feedback. In addition, computer self-efficacy and perceived enjoyment significantly influenced Thai teachers\u2019 perception of ease of use.",
