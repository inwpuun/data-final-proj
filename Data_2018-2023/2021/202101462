                "abstracts": "© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe present study aimed to estimate the proportion of bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) in dogs and cats, assess risks associated with bacterial UTI, and to determine bacterial isolates' antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance pattern from the urinary tract of dogs and cats with urologic problems. The medical records from animals visiting Chiang Mai University Small Animal Veterinary Teaching Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016 were reviewed. In total, 203 dogs and 49 cats with urinary tract diseases that had samples submitted for bacterial culture were identified;198 and 24 bacterial isolates were recovered from dogs' and cats' submitted samples, respectively. At least one episode of bacterial UTI was detected in 75.4% (95% CI: 69.4\u201381.3) of dogs and in 40.8% (95% CI: 26.6\u201355.1) of cats with UTI and submitted urine cultures. Of 242 submitted urinary samples from dogs and 60 urinary samples from cats, bacteria were identified in 74.0% (95% CI: 68.4\u201379.5) and 38.3% (95% CI: 26.0\u201350.6), respectively. The most common pathogen of bacteria positive cultured from dogs was Staphylococcus spp. (30.3%), followed by Escherichia coli (16.7%), and Proteus spp. (13.6%). For cats, the most common pathogen was Pseudomonas spp. (25.0%), followed by E. coli (20.8%) and Proteus spp. (16.7%). Staphylococcus spp. isolates from dogs and Proteus spp. isolates from cats were highly susceptible to Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) at 88% and 75%, respectively. Of all isolated bacteria, 67.1% of the bacteria from dogs and 83.3% from cats were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The proportion of MDR-bacterial urinary tract infections in dogs and cats with urologic problems in this study was high. This observation raises concerns regarding the potential of zoonotic transmission of MDR-bacteria from these companion animals. The results suggested that AMC remains a good empirical drug for treating UTIs in dogs in this region.",

The medical records from animals visiting Chiang Mai University Small Animal Veterinary Teaching Hospital between January 2012 and December 2016 were reviewed. In total, 203 dogs and 49 cats with urinary tract diseases that had samples submitted for bacterial culture were identified;198 and 24 bacterial isolates were recovered from dogs' and cats' submitted samples, respectively. At least one episode of bacterial UTI was detected in 75.4% (95% CI: 69.4\u201381.3) of dogs and in 40.8% (95% CI: 26.6\u201355.1) of cats with UTI and submitted urine cultures. Of 242 submitted urinary samples from dogs and 60 urinary samples from cats, bacteria were identified in 74.0% (95% CI: 68.4\u201379.5) and 38.3% (95% CI: 26.0\u201350.6), respectively. The most common pathogen of bacteria positive cultured from dogs was Staphylococcus spp. (30.3%), followed by Escherichia coli (16.7%), and Proteus spp. (13.6%). For cats, the most common pathogen was Pseudomonas spp. (25.0%), followed by E. coli (20.8%) and Proteus spp. (16.7%). Staphylococcus spp. isolates from dogs and Proteus spp. isolates from cats were highly susceptible to Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) at 88% and 75%, respectively. Of all isolated bacteria, 67.1% of the bacteria from dogs and 83.3% from cats were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The proportion of MDR-bacterial urinary tract infections in dogs and cats with urologic problems in this study was high. This observation raises concerns regarding the potential of zoonotic transmission of MDR-bacteria from these companion animals. The results suggested that AMC remains a good empirical drug for treating UTIs in dogs in this region.",
