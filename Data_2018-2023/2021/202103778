                "abstracts": "© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Background: Epilepsy is a common pediatric neurologic disease in Thailand. However, the mainstay antiepileptic pharmacotherapies can induce severe side effects. While the benefit of playing Mozart K.448 music has been studied as an alternative, supplementary, nonpharmacologic treatment for epilepsy, the literature features limited few randomized controlled trial studies of children. Objective: We aimed to study the effect of Mozart K.448 for two pianos on interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with epilepsy. Methods: We employed a single-blinded randomized trial design with a placebo control. The treatment group listened to the first 8 min of Mozart K.448 for two pianos during EEG recording. The control group underwent an EEG recording of the same duration in a quiet environment. Interictal epileptiform discharges were manually counted for 8 min before, during, and after the song was plated. Quantitative electroencephalogram and HRV were analyzed in each period. Result: A total of 32 patients aged 0\u201318 years were enrolled. There were 12 patients in the music group and 14 patients in the control group; 67% of the patients in the former exhibited significantly decreased IEDs while listening to the music compared with 42% of the patients in the quiet group (RR [Relative Risk Reduction]: 0.72, p-value: < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69\u20130.74). During music exposure, qEEG demonstrated an increase in the delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio relative to that of controls (median in music: + 3% and control: − 6%, p-value: 0.520). Heart rate variability analyses showed a decrease in the ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF), which represents parasympathetic activity during music exposure (decrease of 34%, p-value: 0.382). Conclusion: The present study showed that Mozart K.448 reduced the number of IEDs in children with epilepsy and that Mozart K.448 could enhance parasympathetic activity. However, possibly because of the small study population, statistical significance was not reached. Our study revealed the considerable potential of music in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Epilepsy is a common pediatric neurologic disease in Thailand. However, the mainstay antiepileptic pharmacotherapies can induce severe side effects. While the benefit of playing Mozart K.448 music has been studied as an alternative, supplementary, nonpharmacologic treatment for epilepsy, the literature features limited few randomized controlled trial studies of children. Objective: We aimed to study the effect of Mozart K.448 for two pianos on interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with epilepsy. Methods: We employed a single-blinded randomized trial design with a placebo control. The treatment group listened to the first 8 min of Mozart K.448 for two pianos during EEG recording. The control group underwent an EEG recording of the same duration in a quiet environment. Interictal epileptiform discharges were manually counted for 8 min before, during, and after the song was plated. Quantitative electroencephalogram and HRV were analyzed in each period. Result: A total of 32 patients aged 0\u201318 years were enrolled. There were 12 patients in the music group and 14 patients in the control group; 67% of the patients in the former exhibited significantly decreased IEDs while listening to the music compared with 42% of the patients in the quiet group (RR [Relative Risk Reduction]: 0.72, p-value: < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69\u20130.74). During music exposure, qEEG demonstrated an increase in the delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio relative to that of controls (median in music: + 3% and control: − 6%, p-value: 0.520). Heart rate variability analyses showed a decrease in the ratio of low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF), which represents parasympathetic activity during music exposure (decrease of 34%, p-value: 0.382). Conclusion: The present study showed that Mozart K.448 reduced the number of IEDs in children with epilepsy and that Mozart K.448 could enhance parasympathetic activity. However, possibly because of the small study population, statistical significance was not reached. Our study revealed the considerable potential of music in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy.",
