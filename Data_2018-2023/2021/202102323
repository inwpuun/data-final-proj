                "abstracts": "© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Autophagic cell death (ACD) is an alternative death mechanism in resistant malignant cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated how polyphenol stilbene compound PE5 exhibits po-tent ACD\u2010promoting activity in lung cancer cells that may offer an opportunity for novel cancer treatment. Cell death caused by PE5 was found to be concomitant with dramatic autophagy induc-tion, as indicated by acidic vesicle staining, autophagosome, and the LC3 conversion. We further confirmed that the main death induction caused by PE5 was via ACD, since the co\u2010treatment with an autophagy inhibitor could reverse PE5\u2010mediated cell death. Furthermore, the defined mechanism of action and upstream regulatory signals were identified using proteomic analysis. Time-dependent proteomic analysis showed that PE5 affected 2142 and 1996 proteins after 12 and 24 h of treatment, respectively. The crosstalk network comprising 128 proteins that control apoptosis and 25 proteins involved in autophagy was identified. Protein\u2013protein interaction analysis further indicated that the induction of ACD was via AKT/mTOR and Bcl\u20102 suppression. Western blot analysis confirmed that the active forms of AKT, mTOR, and Bcl\u20102 were decreased in PE5\u2010treated cells. Taken together, we demonstrated the novel mechanism of PE5 in shifting autophagy toward cell death induction by targeting AKT/mTOR and Bcl\u20102 suppression.",

        "dc:description": "Autophagic cell death (ACD) is an alternative death mechanism in resistant malignant cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated how polyphenol stilbene compound PE5 exhibits po-tent ACD\u2010promoting activity in lung cancer cells that may offer an opportunity for novel cancer treatment. Cell death caused by PE5 was found to be concomitant with dramatic autophagy induc-tion, as indicated by acidic vesicle staining, autophagosome, and the LC3 conversion. We further confirmed that the main death induction caused by PE5 was via ACD, since the co\u2010treatment with an autophagy inhibitor could reverse PE5\u2010mediated cell death. Furthermore, the defined mechanism of action and upstream regulatory signals were identified using proteomic analysis. Time-dependent proteomic analysis showed that PE5 affected 2142 and 1996 proteins after 12 and 24 h of treatment, respectively. The crosstalk network comprising 128 proteins that control apoptosis and 25 proteins involved in autophagy was identified. Protein\u2013protein interaction analysis further indicated that the induction of ACD was via AKT/mTOR and Bcl\u20102 suppression. Western blot analysis confirmed that the active forms of AKT, mTOR, and Bcl\u20102 were decreased in PE5\u2010treated cells. Taken together, we demonstrated the novel mechanism of PE5 in shifting autophagy toward cell death induction by targeting AKT/mTOR and Bcl\u20102 suppression.",
