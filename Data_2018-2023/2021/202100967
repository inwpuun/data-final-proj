                "abstracts": "© 2021 Elsevier LtdWastewater is always composed of different pollutants, most of which are toxic to the living being. It is very tough to separate all those diverse groups of contaminants using a single process or single material. Rather a sustainable and environment friendly processes should be adapted to restrict the secondary pollution generation. Nanoclay and its nanocomposites are one of the most used adsorbents that have been modified and used for the separation of almost all types of pollutants, including dyes, heavy metals, fluoride, nitrate, ammonia, emerging pollutants and bacteria. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to exploit and relatively maintenance-free. Thus, recent research bloomed for developing suitable adsorbents, including clay nanocomposites. The advantages and drawbacks of all the clay nanocomposites-based processes have been discussed critically in this article. Nano-clays or other nanoparticles incorporated synthetic and natural polymers-based clay nanocomposites were synthesized, and it was found that they can remove dyes in the range between 48 mg/g and 1994 mg/g. Similarly, they separate a diverse group of heavy metal ions, including As, Cu, Co, Pd, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Hg, in the range of 0.073\u20131667 mg/g. The clay nanocomposites also showed fluoride removal efficacy in the range of 0.134\u201323 mg/g. They are also useful for the separation of emerging pollutants like pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, trace elements, and particulate matters in the range of 0.1\u2013651 mg/g the clay nanocomposites showed considerable nitrate, ammonia and bacteria removal efficacy too. Though it seems promising, more investigations with real wastewater and pilot-scale studies are recommended to explore large-scale wastewater treatment capabilities.",

        "dc:description": "Wastewater is always composed of different pollutants, most of which are toxic to the living being. It is very tough to separate all those diverse groups of contaminants using a single process or single material. Rather a sustainable and environment friendly processes should be adapted to restrict the secondary pollution generation. Nanoclay and its nanocomposites are one of the most used adsorbents that have been modified and used for the separation of almost all types of pollutants, including dyes, heavy metals, fluoride, nitrate, ammonia, emerging pollutants and bacteria. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to exploit and relatively maintenance-free. Thus, recent research bloomed for developing suitable adsorbents, including clay nanocomposites. The advantages and drawbacks of all the clay nanocomposites-based processes have been discussed critically in this article. Nano-clays or other nanoparticles incorporated synthetic and natural polymers-based clay nanocomposites were synthesized, and it was found that they can remove dyes in the range between 48 mg/g and 1994 mg/g. Similarly, they separate a diverse group of heavy metal ions, including As, Cu, Co, Pd, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cd, and Hg, in the range of 0.073\u20131667 mg/g. The clay nanocomposites also showed fluoride removal efficacy in the range of 0.134\u201323 mg/g. They are also useful for the separation of emerging pollutants like pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, trace elements, and particulate matters in the range of 0.1\u2013651 mg/g the clay nanocomposites showed considerable nitrate, ammonia and bacteria removal efficacy too. Though it seems promising, more investigations with real wastewater and pilot-scale studies are recommended to explore large-scale wastewater treatment capabilities.",
