                {"$": "Climate has changed throughout history and can drive changes in certain ecosystems. A study of long-term data such as palaeoecological records provides a record of how ecosystems actually responded to change, whether driven by shifts in climate or human activity. The palaeoecological study can also provide a unique historical perspective on the biodiversity conservation and management of ecosystems (Willis and Birks ). In 2002\u20132007 the Western Thong Pha Phum Project took place, funded by the Biodiversity Research and Training Program of Thailand (BRT) and the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT). This provided for research on biodiversity conservation in the west of Thailand, especially in a small protected area of about 50 km in the sub-district Huai Khayeng located in the western Thong Pha Phum District, Kanchanaburi Province. Therefore exploration of various families of organisms was conducted in the area. Up to date, at least 800 plant species have been found: eight bryophytes, five lycophytes and molinophytes and seven flowering plants were newly recorded for Thailand (Boonkerd ) and at least 197 aquatic insects, 91 fish (Beamish ) and 18 mammals (Prayong and Srikosamatara ) were recorded that are important for people living in the western part of the country. This area is also geographically diverse, ranging from an altitude of 200 to 1,100 m and is crucial for human settlement and land use, including agriculture and tin mining (Boonkerd and Pollawatn ). Thong Pha Phum contains various types of forest including a special forest type rarely found in Thailand called freshwater spring forest. Freshwater spring forest is inundated by freshwater throughout the year (Darumas et al. ) and is a type of wetland that contains high biodiversity. A plant survey of freshwater spring forests in Thong Pha Phum found 24 species of lycophyte and molinophytes, and 249 species of flowering plants (Darumas et al. ). The area has four endemic species, including two rare endemic species, and 11 species of vascular plants are listed as threatened plants in Thailand (Darumas et al. ). Moreover, these freshwater spring forests are home to at least 37 amphibians (Khonsue ), aquatic insects, crabs, shellfish and fish (Beamish ). 2"},

The results demonstrate that there were changes in plant composition over the past 700 years resulting from interactions between hydrological conditions in relation to rainfall variability, and anthropogenic activity. Open vegetation such as grasses and lowland forest were established in Nong Pling freshwater spring forest from at least around ad 1300 suggesting drier conditions than present until around ad 1460. After that, decreased lowland forest and increased freshwater spring taxa together with the low charcoal contents indicate wetter conditions than during the former period, which allowed freshwater spring taxa to establish until around ad 1800. There were some fluctuations between freshwater spring taxa and lowland forest with open vegetation, probably due to rainfall fluctuations particularly after ad 1800 until the present. Moreover, recent increases in total charcoal accumulation, especially in large particles and the appearance of domesticated grass pollen may be related to recent human interaction within the ecosystems in Thong Pha Phum.",

The results demonstrate that there were changes in plant composition over the past 700 years resulting from interactions between hydrological conditions in relation to rainfall variability, and anthropogenic activity. Open vegetation such as grasses and lowland forest were established in Nong Pling freshwater spring forest from at least around ad 1300 suggesting drier conditions than present until around ad 1460. After that, decreased lowland forest and increased freshwater spring taxa together with the low charcoal contents indicate wetter conditions than during the former period, which allowed freshwater spring taxa to establish until around ad 1800. There were some fluctuations between freshwater spring taxa and lowland forest with open vegetation, probably due to rainfall fluctuations particularly after ad 1800 until the present. Moreover, recent increases in total charcoal accumulation, especially in large particles and the appearance of domesticated grass pollen may be related to recent human interaction within the ecosystems in Thong Pha Phum.",
