                "abstracts": "© 2021. All Rights Reserved.This paper investigates the factors of personal demographics, corporate image, and the marketing mix, which influence customer motives regarding consumption at MK suki restaurants. Cluster sampling of 400 MK suki restaurant customers in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, was conducted at four branches: Central Ubon Ratchathani, Tesco Lotus Ubon Ratchathani, Big C Ubon Ratchathani, and Big C Warin Chamrap. The questionnaire developed had high internal validity and high reliability, indicting its adequacy for providing information on the personal factors, corporate image, and marketing mix factors regarding customer motives. The statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the independent variables were correlated with (r = 0.76) customer motives at a high level. The marketing mix and corporate image could predict 56% (R2-adjusted = 0.56) of customer motivation. The independent variables affecting customer motives with a statistical significance at the 0.01 level were marketing promotion, distribution channel, goods and services, and atmosphere. One potential application of the study\u2019s results is in improving business management using various imperative strategies, at both MK Restaurant and other restaurants. Examples of these imperative strategies include the restaurant climate and promotion activities which help to create a competitive advantage and improved customer satisfaction. Moreover, to persuade new customers with good products and services, increasing distribution channels and corporate social responsibility were found to be vital, as well as helping to create business sustainability and meet consumers\u2019 needs.",

Cluster sampling of 400 MK suki restaurant customers in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, was conducted at four branches: Central Ubon Ratchathani, Tesco Lotus Ubon Ratchathani, Big C Ubon Ratchathani, and Big C Warin Chamrap. The questionnaire developed had high internal validity and high reliability, indicting its adequacy for providing information on the personal factors, corporate image, and marketing mix factors regarding customer motives. The statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the independent variables were correlated with (r = 0.76) customer motives at a high level. The marketing mix and corporate image could predict 56% (R2-adjusted = 0.56) of customer motivation. The independent variables affecting customer motives with a statistical significance at the 0.01 level were marketing promotion, distribution channel, goods and services, and atmosphere. One potential application of the study\u2019s results is in improving business management using various imperative strategies, at both MK Restaurant and other restaurants. Examples of these imperative strategies include the restaurant climate and promotion activities which help to create a competitive advantage and improved customer satisfaction. Moreover, to persuade new customers with good products and services, increasing distribution channels and corporate social responsibility were found to be vital, as well as helping to create business sustainability and meet consumers\u2019 needs.",
