                "abstracts": "© JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF Thailand | 2021Background: Vascular calcification in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is correlated with uremic toxins and severely impaired calcium-phosphate-parathyroid metabolism. The association factors of vascular calcification in early-stage CKD are still unestablished. Objective: To identify the risk factors for vascular calcification in the early-stage CKD, which was the non-target population, different from other previous studies that explored this association in advanced stage CKD. Materials and Methods: The present study was a longitudinal study conducted to examine the risk factors of vascular calcification in CKD stage G2 and G3 patients who had no previous cardiovascular diseases. All parameters including coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) at baseline and after twelve months were evaluated. Results: Twenty-two patients without established cardiovascular diseases were included and completed the follow-up period. Mean baseline LDL was 99 mg/dL and no patient received statin. At 12-month, the median CAC score was significantly increased to 266 (126 to 956) versus 282 (198 to 846), (p=0.024]. By multivariable analysis in generalized estimating equations, only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with CAC score greater than 400 (aOR 0.92, p=0.041), and AAC score greater than 5 (aOR 0.90, p=0.023). Conclusion: In early-stage CKD, eGFR was associated with vascular calcification. Further studies should explore the potential benefits of delaying CKD progression on vascular calcification in the early-stage CKD patients.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Vascular calcification in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is correlated with uremic toxins and severely impaired calcium-phosphate-parathyroid metabolism. The association factors of vascular calcification in early-stage CKD are still unestablished. Objective: To identify the risk factors for vascular calcification in the early-stage CKD, which was the non-target population, different from other previous studies that explored this association in advanced stage CKD. Materials and Methods: The present study was a longitudinal study conducted to examine the risk factors of vascular calcification in CKD stage G2 and G3 patients who had no previous cardiovascular diseases. All parameters including coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) at baseline and after twelve months were evaluated. Results: Twenty-two patients without established cardiovascular diseases were included and completed the follow-up period. Mean baseline LDL was 99 mg/dL and no patient received statin. At 12-month, the median CAC score was significantly increased to 266 (126 to 956) versus 282 (198 to 846), (p=0.024]. By multivariable analysis in generalized estimating equations, only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with CAC score greater than 400 (aOR 0.92, p=0.041), and AAC score greater than 5 (aOR 0.90, p=0.023). Conclusion: In early-stage CKD, eGFR was associated with vascular calcification. Further studies should explore the potential benefits of delaying CKD progression on vascular calcification in the early-stage CKD patients.",
