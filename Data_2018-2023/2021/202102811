                "abstracts": "© 2020 Elsevier LtdThis study is to develop a novel integrated single-stage anaerobic co-digestion and oxidation ditch membrane bioreactor (SAC/OD-MBR) for food waste and building wastewater recycling. The co-digestion of food waste (FW) from a canteen with waste sludge (WS) from OD-MBR was performed with the proportion of FW:WS at 10:1 by weight. The liquid digestate from the co-digestion process was further co-treated with building wastewater in the OD-MBR system for water reuse purpose. Maximum methane content of 65.2% in biogas as well as average specific methane yield of 0.24 gCH4/gVS could be obtained with anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and waste sludge from OD-MBR with HRT of 24 h and horizontal flow velocity of 0.3 m/s. The observed main methanogen species in this co-digestion process were Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanoculleus palmolei. For co-treatment of liquid digestate and building wastewater with the OD-MBR, it was found that HRT of 24 h and horizontal flow velocity of 0.3 m/s could achieve highest COD and nitrogen removal efficiencies. HRT can be considered as a main key parameter to promote nitrification activity inside the OD-MBR system. Moreover, treated effluent from the SAC/OD-MBR could comply with the water reuse standard for garden and landscape application in the university campus. Furthermore, the techno-economic analysis indicates that this proposed system has a high potential of total cost savings and other indirect benefits. Therefore, the prototype SAC/OD-MBR can be an alternative system for food waste management and wastewater recycling for building application.",

                        "$": "From the overall experiments shown in Fig. 5, the highest treatment efficiencies for COD and TKN-nitrogen at 93.77% and 85.57%, respectively could be achieved with the operating HRT 24 h and horizontal flow velocity 0.3 m/s. When the operating HRT was decreased from 24 h to 12 h, the reduction in COD removal efficiencies were slightly decreased. While it resulted in a significant decrease in TKN-nitrogen removal efficiencies. The concentrations of TKN nitrogen in the mixed wastewater for all experimental runs were in the range of 300\u2013436 mgN/L. From Fig. 5(b), TKN-nitrogen removal percentage was approximately 20% increased with an increase in HRT from 12 to 24 h. An increase in horizontal flow velocity from 0.3 to 0.6 m/s could improve TKN removal efficiency around 10%. Therefore, hydraulic retention time, HRT is one of the main key parameters to promote nitrification activity inside the OD-MBR system. Similar research work by Liu and Wang (2015) also suggested that longer HRT can support higher nitrification efficiency in the single oxidation tank. However, horizontal flow velocity 0.3 m/s shows the same nitrification activity degree as that of 0.6 m/s (only ± 5% difference). Abusam et al. (2002) also reported that horizontal flow velocity from 0.2 to 0.6 m/s did not affect the performance of nitrification activity in oxidation ditch tank. However, the horizontal flow velocity could obviously affect denitrification activity in the tank. Higher horizontal flow velocity resulted in higher total nitrogen removal efficiency. Li et al. (2019) applied the CANON process with oxidation ditch reactor, the total nitrogen removal could be achieved at 82.17%. The phenomena of SND (simultaneous nitrification-denitrification) was also informed to exist in their reactor by setting the ratio of aeration period to non-aeration period in the oxidation pond to 3 h:1 h. The DO stratification can promote simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (SND) in the system (Guo et al., 2012).This research work was financially supported by National Research Council of Thailand and Interdisciplinary Program of Environmental Science, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University.",

        "dc:description": "This study is to develop a novel integrated single-stage anaerobic co-digestion and oxidation ditch membrane bioreactor (SAC/OD-MBR) for food waste and building wastewater recycling. The co-digestion of food waste (FW) from a canteen with waste sludge (WS) from OD-MBR was performed with the proportion of FW:WS at 10:1 by weight. The liquid digestate from the co-digestion process was further co-treated with building wastewater in the OD-MBR system for water reuse purpose. Maximum methane content of 65.2% in biogas as well as average specific methane yield of 0.24 gCH4/gVS could be obtained with anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and waste sludge from OD-MBR with HRT of 24 h and horizontal flow velocity of 0.3 m/s. The observed main methanogen species in this co-digestion process were Methanoculleus bourgensis and Methanoculleus palmolei. For co-treatment of liquid digestate and building wastewater with the OD-MBR, it was found that HRT of 24 h and horizontal flow velocity of 0.3 m/s could achieve highest COD and nitrogen removal efficiencies. HRT can be considered as a main key parameter to promote nitrification activity inside the OD-MBR system. Moreover, treated effluent from the SAC/OD-MBR could comply with the water reuse standard for garden and landscape application in the university campus. Furthermore, the techno-economic analysis indicates that this proposed system has a high potential of total cost savings and other indirect benefits. Therefore, the prototype SAC/OD-MBR can be an alternative system for food waste management and wastewater recycling for building application.",
