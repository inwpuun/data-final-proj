The research method used in this study was Mixed Method Design. There were three groups of informants; The first group for quantitative research through questionnaire consisted of school leaders, teachers, chairman of school board, community representative, alumni and parents, with 370 samples. The research instrument used was a 5 level rating scale questionnaire. The data were analyzed by using frequency distribution, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. The second group for qualitative research through interview consisted of experts and specialists in human resource management, educational management, school management, school supervision and teaching, totally 20 people. The third group for validating and fine tuning the draft through focus group consisted of 18 experts and educational stakeholders. The research findings were concluded with two new approaches for school leader\u2019s position-entry, which are Track 1 approach: The approach for Tenure School Leader Position-Entry, and Track 2 approach: The approach for Contracted-School Leader Position-Entry. In both approaches, the candidates require the same set of qualifications, characteristics, competencies, and same selection process. The differences between two approaches are on the term of appointment and performance evaluation system. Under Track 1 approach, there is tenure appointment up to retirement and no assessment process for renewal. In track 2 approach, there is a four-year term of appointment and assessment process for contract renewal.",

        "dc:description": "The purpose of this study was to develop a new position-entry approach for Thai school leader in the future. The research method used in this study was Mixed Method Design. There were three groups of informants; The first group for quantitative research through questionnaire consisted of school leaders, teachers, chairman of school board, community representative, alumni and parents, with 370 samples. The research instrument used was a 5 level rating scale questionnaire. The data were analyzed by using frequency distribution, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. The second group for qualitative research through interview consisted of experts and specialists in human resource management, educational management, school management, school supervision and teaching, totally 20 people. The third group for validating and fine tuning the draft through focus group consisted of 18 experts and educational stakeholders. The research findings were concluded with two new approaches for school leader\u2019s position-entry, which are Track 1 approach: The approach for Tenure School Leader Position-Entry, and Track 2 approach: The approach for Contracted-School Leader Position-Entry. In both approaches, the candidates require the same set of qualifications, characteristics, competencies, and same selection process. The differences between two approaches are on the term of appointment and performance evaluation system. Under Track 1 approach, there is tenure appointment up to retirement and no assessment process for renewal. In track 2 approach, there is a four-year term of appointment and assessment process for contract renewal.",
