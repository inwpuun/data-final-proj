To prevent salinity effects on rice yields, genetic diversity concerning salt tolerance must be evaluated. In this study, we investigated the salinity responses of rice (Oryza sativa) to determine the critical genes. The transcriptomes of \u2018Luang Pratahn\u2019 rice, a local Thai rice variety with high salt tolerance, were used as a model for analyzing and identifying the key genes responsible for salt-stress tolerance. Based on 3' Tag-Seq data from the time course of salt-stress treatment, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify key genes in gene modules. We obtained 1,386 significantly differentially expressed genes in eight modules. Among them, six modules indicated a significant correlation within 6, 12, or 48h after salt stress. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the co-expressed genes of interesting modules to reveal which genes were mainly enriched within important functions for salt-stress responses. To identify the key genes in salt-stress responses, we considered the two-state co-expression networks, normal growth conditions, and salt stress to investigate which genes were less important in a normal situation but gained more impact under stress. We identified key genes for the response to biotic and abiotic stimuli and tolerance to salt stress. Thus, these novel genes may play important roles in salinity tolerance and serve as potential biomarkers to improve salt tolerance cultivars.",

        "dc:description": "Salinity is an important environmental factor causing a negative effect on rice production. To prevent salinity effects on rice yields, genetic diversity concerning salt tolerance must be evaluated. In this study, we investigated the salinity responses of rice (Oryza sativa) to determine the critical genes. The transcriptomes of \u2018Luang Pratahn\u2019 rice, a local Thai rice variety with high salt tolerance, were used as a model for analyzing and identifying the key genes responsible for salt-stress tolerance. Based on 3' Tag-Seq data from the time course of salt-stress treatment, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify key genes in gene modules. We obtained 1,386 significantly differentially expressed genes in eight modules. Among them, six modules indicated a significant correlation within 6, 12, or 48h after salt stress. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the co-expressed genes of interesting modules to reveal which genes were mainly enriched within important functions for salt-stress responses. To identify the key genes in salt-stress responses, we considered the two-state co-expression networks, normal growth conditions, and salt stress to investigate which genes were less important in a normal situation but gained more impact under stress. We identified key genes for the response to biotic and abiotic stimuli and tolerance to salt stress. Thus, these novel genes may play important roles in salinity tolerance and serve as potential biomarkers to improve salt tolerance cultivars.",
