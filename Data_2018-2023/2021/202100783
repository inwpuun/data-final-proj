                "abstracts": "© 2021 American Physical SocietyThe greybody factor of the massive Dirac field around the black hole in the dRGT massive gravity theory is investigated using the rigorous bound and the WKB approximation methods. In both methods, the greybody factor significantly depends on the shape of the potential. If the potential is smaller, there is more probability for the Dirac field to transmit through the black hole, therefore, the greybody factor is higher. Moreover, there exists a critical mass of the Dirac field such that the greybody factor is maximum. By comparing the results from these two methods, we argue that it is useful to use the rigorous bound method for the low potential cases, while using the WKB approximation method for the high potential cases.",

        "dc:description": "The greybody factor of the massive Dirac field around the black hole in the dRGT massive gravity theory is investigated using the rigorous bound and the WKB approximation methods. In both methods, the greybody factor significantly depends on the shape of the potential. If the potential is smaller, there is more probability for the Dirac field to transmit through the black hole, therefore, the greybody factor is higher. Moreover, there exists a critical mass of the Dirac field such that the greybody factor is maximum. By comparing the results from these two methods, we argue that it is useful to use the rigorous bound method for the low potential cases, while using the WKB approximation method for the high potential cases.",
