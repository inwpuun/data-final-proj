                "abstracts": "© 2021, The Author(s).Novel and sensitive biomarkers is highly required for early detection and predicting prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated transcription profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 8 patients with HCC and PBMCs from co-culture model with HCC using RNA-Sequencing. These transcription profiles were cross compared with published microarray datasets of PBMCs in HCC to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A total of commonly identified of 24 DEGs among these data were proposed as cancer-induced genes in PBMCs, including 18 upregulated and 6 downregulated DEGs. The KEGG pathway showed that these enriched genes were mainly associated with immune responses. Five up-regulated candidate genes including BHLHE40, AREG, SOCS1, CCL5, and DDIT4 were selected and further validated in PBMCs of 100 patients with HBV-related HCC, 100 patients with chronic HBV infection and 100 healthy controls. Based on ROC analysis, BHLHE40 and DDIT4 displayed better diagnostic performance than alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in discriminating HCC from controls. Additionally, BHLHE40 and DDIT4 had high sensitivity for detecting AFP-negative and early-stage HCC. BHLHE40 was also emerged as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival of HCC. Together, our study indicated that BHLHE40 in PBMCs could be a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HBV-related HCC.",

        "dc:description": "Novel and sensitive biomarkers is highly required for early detection and predicting prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated transcription profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 8 patients with HCC and PBMCs from co-culture model with HCC using RNA-Sequencing. These transcription profiles were cross compared with published microarray datasets of PBMCs in HCC to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A total of commonly identified of 24 DEGs among these data were proposed as cancer-induced genes in PBMCs, including 18 upregulated and 6 downregulated DEGs. The KEGG pathway showed that these enriched genes were mainly associated with immune responses. Five up-regulated candidate genes including BHLHE40, AREG, SOCS1, CCL5, and DDIT4 were selected and further validated in PBMCs of 100 patients with HBV-related HCC, 100 patients with chronic HBV infection and 100 healthy controls. Based on ROC analysis, BHLHE40 and DDIT4 displayed better diagnostic performance than alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in discriminating HCC from controls. Additionally, BHLHE40 and DDIT4 had high sensitivity for detecting AFP-negative and early-stage HCC. BHLHE40 was also emerged as an independent prognostic factor of overall survival of HCC. Together, our study indicated that BHLHE40 in PBMCs could be a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HBV-related HCC.",
