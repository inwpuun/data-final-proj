                "abstracts": "© 2021 IEEE.The control of economic activities by governments for the purpose of minimizing COVID-19 spread influenced atmospheric conditions. Satellite-based technology is promising to monitor these changes and even non-specialists in geospatial analysis can use it through cloud-based open platforms. This study aims to give scientific interpretation on the causes of the atmospheric changes based on these governmental controls on human activity. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were monitored in Ayutthaya Province in Thailand in an urban area including industrial zones during January 1 to April 30, 2020. An analysis was conducted with Google Earth Engine by using four datasets including NO2 data from Sentinel-5P. The mean value of NO2 density in 2020 decreased 12.5% compared with that in 2019. The closure of industrial facilities by the government seemed to be a key cause of the phenomena. The decline was statistically tested and resulted in a significant difference between the two periods. As the new daily cases decreased to single digits, the difference became non-significant from May 1, 2020. Single timeseries analysis on NO2 density change enabled visualization of the brief impact of responses and policies made by the government and subsequent economic activities; however, further atmospheric and industrial activity data are required for further assessment.",

        "dc:description": "The control of economic activities by governments for the purpose of minimizing COVID-19 spread influenced atmospheric conditions. Satellite-based technology is promising to monitor these changes and even non-specialists in geospatial analysis can use it through cloud-based open platforms. This study aims to give scientific interpretation on the causes of the atmospheric changes based on these governmental controls on human activity. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were monitored in Ayutthaya Province in Thailand in an urban area including industrial zones during January 1 to April 30, 2020. An analysis was conducted with Google Earth Engine by using four datasets including NO2 data from Sentinel-5P. The mean value of NO2 density in 2020 decreased 12.5% compared with that in 2019. The closure of industrial facilities by the government seemed to be a key cause of the phenomena. The decline was statistically tested and resulted in a significant difference between the two periods. As the new daily cases decreased to single digits, the difference became non-significant from May 1, 2020. Single timeseries analysis on NO2 density change enabled visualization of the brief impact of responses and policies made by the government and subsequent economic activities; however, further atmospheric and industrial activity data are required for further assessment.",
