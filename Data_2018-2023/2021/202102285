                "abstracts": "© Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.This study aimed to investigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) characteristics of Escherichia coli isolates from pig origin (including pigs, pig carcass, and pork) and humans in Thailand and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) border provinces. The majority of the E. coli isolates from Thailand (69.7%) and Lao PDR (63.3%) exhibited multidrug resistance. Class 1 integrons with resistance gene cassettes were common (n = 43), of which the most predominant resistance gene cassette was aadA1. The percentage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers was 3.4 in Thailand and 3.2 in Lao PDR. The ESBL genes found were blaCTX-M14, blaCTX-M27, and blaCTX-M55, of which blaCTX-M55 was the most common (58.6%). Ser-83-Leu and Asp-87-Asn were the predominant amino acid changes in GyrA of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. Twenty-two percent of all isolates were positive for qnrS. Class 1 integrons carrying aadA1 from pigs (n = 1) and ESBL genes (blaCTX-M55 and blaCTX-M14) from pigs (n = 2), pork (n = 1), and humans (n = 7) were located on conjugative plasmids. Most plasmids (29.3%) were typed in the IncFrepB group. In conclusion, AMR E. coli are common in pig origin and humans in these areas. The findings confirm AMR as One Health issue, and highlight the need for comprehensive and unified collaborations within and between sectors on research and policy.",

        "dc:description": "This study aimed to investigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) characteristics of Escherichia coli isolates from pig origin (including pigs, pig carcass, and pork) and humans in Thailand and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) border provinces. The majority of the E. coli isolates from Thailand (69.7%) and Lao PDR (63.3%) exhibited multidrug resistance. Class 1 integrons with resistance gene cassettes were common (n = 43), of which the most predominant resistance gene cassette was aadA1. The percentage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers was 3.4 in Thailand and 3.2 in Lao PDR. The ESBL genes found were blaCTX-M14, blaCTX-M27, and blaCTX-M55, of which blaCTX-M55 was the most common (58.6%). Ser-83-Leu and Asp-87-Asn were the predominant amino acid changes in GyrA of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. Twenty-two percent of all isolates were positive for qnrS. Class 1 integrons carrying aadA1 from pigs (n = 1) and ESBL genes (blaCTX-M55 and blaCTX-M14) from pigs (n = 2), pork (n = 1), and humans (n = 7) were located on conjugative plasmids. Most plasmids (29.3%) were typed in the IncFrepB group. In conclusion, AMR E. coli are common in pig origin and humans in these areas. The findings confirm AMR as One Health issue, and highlight the need for comprehensive and unified collaborations within and between sectors on research and policy.",
