The WHO recommends vaccination of multiple cohorts of the primary population at the introduction of the program. Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Haïti, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Malaysia, Nepal, Peru, Rwanda, Uganda, and Vietnam targeted school-based, hospital-facility, and community-based delivery models or mixed model that reported very low attrition from receiving the full three doses [ 27 , 34 , 40 , 45 , 47 ]. Our pooled estimates suggest that among countries that started with overall high uptake, the uptake of vaccination was significantly higher in demonstration projects. The demonstration projects in the initial phases of the vaccination program being introduced in the countries were sponsored by the international non-governmental organizations through the Gardasil Access Program (GAP), the Global Alliance (GAVI), the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), and the Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation (ACCF) [59] achieving the high proportion of vaccination uptake of 89.94%. These projects helped identify and enumerate HPV target population based on birth cohort, student grades, or headcounts whichever available; developed training modules for vaccinators; and mobilized social support from parents, village, and religious leaders [59] . As these demonstration projects withdrew, there was a significant drop in the vaccination uptake in countries that started with overall high uptake, from 89.03% in the female-only vaccination period 2006\u20132014 to 41.48% in the gender-neutral vaccination period post-2014. However, there was a modest increase in uptake from 0.76% to 5.26% in the same time periods in countries that started with overall low uptake.",

                "abstracts": "© 2021 The Author(s)Background: The proportion of incident cases of HPV-attributable cancers is highest in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but many are yet to initiate HPV vaccination programs. This meta-analysis was performed to assess the uptake of HPV vaccination in LMICs at the beginning of the global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer and describes the gaps and challenges. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases for observational studies that reported the uptake of HPV vaccination until October 2020. The meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model to assess the pooled estimate of HPV uptake. CRD42021218429 Findings: During 2008\u20132020, an estimated 3.3 million females received at least one dose of HPV vaccine with 61.69% of the target population vaccinated. In countries with high uptake, the pooled estimate of uptake was higher in females than males (45.48% vs 8.45%) and showed significant decline in 2015\u20132020 compared to 2006\u20132014 (89.03% vs 41.48%). In countries with low uptake, the estimate of uptake was low in both males and females (5.31% vs 2.93%) and showed increase in uptake in 2015\u20132020 compared to 2006\u20132014 (0.76% vs 5.22%). In countries with high uptake, compared to routine programs, the estimate was higher when delivered through demonstration programs (89.94% vs 59.74%). Interpretation: The major concern was a significant drop in the uptake in countries that started with high uptake, challenges in the maintenance of vaccine uptake, sustainability of funding and the lack of standard monitoring and reporting.",

        "dc:description": "Background: The proportion of incident cases of HPV-attributable cancers is highest in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but many are yet to initiate HPV vaccination programs. This meta-analysis was performed to assess the uptake of HPV vaccination in LMICs at the beginning of the global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer and describes the gaps and challenges. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases for observational studies that reported the uptake of HPV vaccination until October 2020. The meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model to assess the pooled estimate of HPV uptake. CRD42021218429 Findings: During 2008\u20132020, an estimated 3.3 million females received at least one dose of HPV vaccine with 61.69% of the target population vaccinated. In countries with high uptake, the pooled estimate of uptake was higher in females than males (45.48% vs 8.45%) and showed significant decline in 2015\u20132020 compared to 2006\u20132014 (89.03% vs 41.48%). In countries with low uptake, the estimate of uptake was low in both males and females (5.31% vs 2.93%) and showed increase in uptake in 2015\u20132020 compared to 2006\u20132014 (0.76% vs 5.22%). In countries with high uptake, compared to routine programs, the estimate was higher when delivered through demonstration programs (89.94% vs 59.74%). Interpretation: The major concern was a significant drop in the uptake in countries that started with high uptake, challenges in the maintenance of vaccine uptake, sustainability of funding and the lack of standard monitoring and reporting.",
