We illustrated the change of academic and clinical psychiatric residency training procedure at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, a developing country situated in South East Asia which is categorized in the low and middle income category of countries. The training setting has set up a task force responsible to set various strategies in response to the COVID-19 measure of social and physical distancing to maintain standard of care for psychiatric patients and educational experience for psychiatric residents. The strategies include online education, service team separation, and avoidance of contact between teams, reduction of non-urgent clinical activities, and the use of telemedicine for psychiatric patients. Despite exposure to the difficulties of training during the pandemic, all senior residents were qualified and licensed at the national examination. Residents reported that pandemic did affect the academic activities and services and also the quality of living and satisfaction. Academic issues, including the inconvenience of studying online, were the most concerned problems among psychiatric residents at the time of pandemic.",

We illustrated the change of academic and clinical psychiatric residency training procedure at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, a developing country situated in South East Asia which is categorized in the low and middle income category of countries. The training setting has set up a task force responsible to set various strategies in response to the COVID-19 measure of social and physical distancing to maintain standard of care for psychiatric patients and educational experience for psychiatric residents. The strategies include online education, service team separation, and avoidance of contact between teams, reduction of non-urgent clinical activities, and the use of telemedicine for psychiatric patients. Despite exposure to the difficulties of training during the pandemic, all senior residents were qualified and licensed at the national examination. Residents reported that pandemic did affect the academic activities and services and also the quality of living and satisfaction. Academic issues, including the inconvenience of studying online, were the most concerned problems among psychiatric residents at the time of pandemic.",
