                {"$": "The spatial distribution of contaminant metals in river sediments displayed a general pattern with increasing concentration from the north to the south and the \u2018hot spots\u2019 identified at the estuaries to the Gulf of Thailand. This pattern was highly in line with the land use switching from forest in the north to agriculture southwards, and followed by intensive urban areas at the estuarine areas (Fig. 1 (B)). An obvious inter-watershed spatial pattern was identified from the maximum contamination level and ecological risk following the order of Chao Phraya > Thachin > Pasak, which was in well consistence with the urbanization gradient among the research watersheds (Table S1). The Pearson correlation results suggested that an elevated development level drove the highly homogeneous pollutant sources to the aquatic environment (e.g., the Chao Phraya watershed). In contrast, diffused and variable pollution sources affected the metal loads simultaneously in a less developed watershed like Pasak (Table S6). The differences with respected to inter-watershed pattern was further supported by the PCA results (Fig. 6 (A)). In addition, the results of SMLR indicated that urban land use brought significant negative impact to the sediment quality due to increased metal contamination. Whereas, agricultural land showed limited effect on sedimentary metals in the studied watersheds (Table 1). Similar contaminant metal distributions obeying the so called \u201curban-rural\u201d gradient were reported in soil, sediment, and surface water matrices globally. For Instance, Mahler et al. (2006) reported that the mass accumulation rates of Cu and Zn in the dense urban lakes were significantly elevated over those in lakes from undeveloped watersheds across the USA. J. Ma et al., 2016a suggested that both spatial and temporal patterns of sediment metal contents were associated with the urbanization process and its intensity. Moreover, Chao Phraya sediments revealed lower median metal concentrations than Thachin sediments, suggesting that urbanization effects on sediment metals may follow an environmental \u201cKuznets Curve\u201d. A similar phenomenon was observed on surface water quality as a response of the urbanization impact by Yu et al. (2014). Hence, the highly urbanized Chao Phraya watershed may have been approaching the peak and a quality improvement of its aquatic environment may be expected in the near future. In contrast, continuous environmental degradation may last at the developing Thachin and Pasak watersheds. Previous research has reported that urbanization elevated sediment metals at various spatial scales including city scale (Li et al., 2011; J. Ma et al., 2016a ), multi-city scale (Yu et al., 2011), and watershed scale (Le Pape et al., 2012; Semrod and Gourley, 2014). Our results further support the idea that urbanization is an important drive of anthropogenic metal enrichment at inter-watershed scale.This study was jointly supported by the National Research Council of Thailand and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41661144033)."}

An obvious metal concentration gradient in response to the intensity of urbanization was found at inter-watershed and intra-watershed scales. Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) exceedances of several metals (Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and high ecological risk were primarily identified at the down streams of Chao Phraya and Thachin watersheds, where the social-economic center of the country with intensive industries is located. Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed significant correlations between studied metals and catchment land use pattern (with p < 0.0001 except for Ni and Cr). Particularly, urban land use showed remarkable effect on sedimentary Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn loads with high coefficients over 0.65. The results of cluster analysis and principal component analysis indicated the dominated urban/industrial sources for Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn, mixed natural and industrial sources for Cr and Ni, and diffuse sources for Hg and As in the watersheds, respectively.",

                        "$": "The spatial distribution of contaminant metals in river sediments displayed a general pattern with increasing concentration from the north to the south and the \u2018hot spots\u2019 identified at the estuaries to the Gulf of Thailand. This pattern was highly in line with the land use switching from forest in the north to agriculture southwards, and followed by intensive urban areas at the estuarine areas (Fig. 1 (B)). An obvious inter-watershed spatial pattern was identified from the maximum contamination level and ecological risk following the order of Chao Phraya > Thachin > Pasak, which was in well consistence with the urbanization gradient among the research watersheds (Table S1). The Pearson correlation results suggested that an elevated development level drove the highly homogeneous pollutant sources to the aquatic environment (e.g., the Chao Phraya watershed). In contrast, diffused and variable pollution sources affected the metal loads simultaneously in a less developed watershed like Pasak (Table S6). The differences with respected to inter-watershed pattern was further supported by the PCA results (Fig. 6 (A)). In addition, the results of SMLR indicated that urban land use brought significant negative impact to the sediment quality due to increased metal contamination. Whereas, agricultural land showed limited effect on sedimentary metals in the studied watersheds (Table 1). Similar contaminant metal distributions obeying the so called \u201curban-rural\u201d gradient were reported in soil, sediment, and surface water matrices globally. For Instance, Mahler et al. (2006) reported that the mass accumulation rates of Cu and Zn in the dense urban lakes were significantly elevated over those in lakes from undeveloped watersheds across the USA. J. Ma et al., 2016a suggested that both spatial and temporal patterns of sediment metal contents were associated with the urbanization process and its intensity. Moreover, Chao Phraya sediments revealed lower median metal concentrations than Thachin sediments, suggesting that urbanization effects on sediment metals may follow an environmental \u201cKuznets Curve\u201d. A similar phenomenon was observed on surface water quality as a response of the urbanization impact by Yu et al. (2014). Hence, the highly urbanized Chao Phraya watershed may have been approaching the peak and a quality improvement of its aquatic environment may be expected in the near future. In contrast, continuous environmental degradation may last at the developing Thachin and Pasak watersheds. Previous research has reported that urbanization elevated sediment metals at various spatial scales including city scale (Li et al., 2011; J. Ma et al., 2016a ), multi-city scale (Yu et al., 2011), and watershed scale (Le Pape et al., 2012; Semrod and Gourley, 2014). Our results further support the idea that urbanization is an important drive of anthropogenic metal enrichment at inter-watershed scale.This study was jointly supported by the National Research Council of Thailand and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41661144033).",

        "dc:description": "The spatial distribution of seven metals (Pb, Hg, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and As in the surface sediments from three major tributaries of a tropical urbanizing river network (i.e., Chao Phraya River, Thachin River, and Pasak River) was investigated. An obvious metal concentration gradient in response to the intensity of urbanization was found at inter-watershed and intra-watershed scales. Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) exceedances of several metals (Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and high ecological risk were primarily identified at the down streams of Chao Phraya and Thachin watersheds, where the social-economic center of the country with intensive industries is located. Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed significant correlations between studied metals and catchment land use pattern (with p < 0.0001 except for Ni and Cr). Particularly, urban land use showed remarkable effect on sedimentary Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn loads with high coefficients over 0.65. The results of cluster analysis and principal component analysis indicated the dominated urban/industrial sources for Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn, mixed natural and industrial sources for Cr and Ni, and diffuse sources for Hg and As in the watersheds, respectively.",
