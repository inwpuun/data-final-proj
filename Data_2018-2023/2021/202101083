This study was aimed at identifying circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel biomarkers for predicting severe liver involvement in patients with leptospirosis. Methods In a discovery set, 12 serum samples of patients with anicteric and icteric leptospirosis at initial clinical presentation were used for miRNA profiling by a NanoString nCounter miRNA assay. In a validated cohort, top candidate miRNAs were selected and further tested by qRT-PCR in serum samples of 81 and 16 individuals with anicteric and icteric leptospirosis, respectively. Results The discovery set identified 38 significantly differential expression miRNAs between the two groups. Among these, miR-601 and miR-630 were selected as the top two candidates significantly up-regulated expressed in the icteric group. The enriched KEGG pathway showed that these miRNAs were mainly involved in immune responses and inflammation. In the validated cohort, miR-601 and miR-630 levels were significantly higher in the icteric group compared with the anicteric group. Additionally, these two miRNAs displayed good predictors of subsequent acute liver failure with a high sensitivity of 100%. On regression analysis, elevated miR-601 and miR-630 expression were also predictive of multi-organ failures and poor overall survival. Conclusion Our data indicated that miRNA expression profiles were significantly differentiated between the icteric and anicteric groups. Serum miR-601 and miR-630 at presentation could potentially serve as promising biomarkers for predicting subsequent acute liver failure and overall survival in patients with leptospirosis.",

        "dc:description": "Background Leptospirosis, a global zoonotic infectious disease, has various clinical manifestations ranging from mild self-limiting illness to life-threatening with multi-organ damage, including liver involvement. This study was aimed at identifying circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel biomarkers for predicting severe liver involvement in patients with leptospirosis. Methods In a discovery set, 12 serum samples of patients with anicteric and icteric leptospirosis at initial clinical presentation were used for miRNA profiling by a NanoString nCounter miRNA assay. In a validated cohort, top candidate miRNAs were selected and further tested by qRT-PCR in serum samples of 81 and 16 individuals with anicteric and icteric leptospirosis, respectively. Results The discovery set identified 38 significantly differential expression miRNAs between the two groups. Among these, miR-601 and miR-630 were selected as the top two candidates significantly up-regulated expressed in the icteric group. The enriched KEGG pathway showed that these miRNAs were mainly involved in immune responses and inflammation. In the validated cohort, miR-601 and miR-630 levels were significantly higher in the icteric group compared with the anicteric group. Additionally, these two miRNAs displayed good predictors of subsequent acute liver failure with a high sensitivity of 100%. On regression analysis, elevated miR-601 and miR-630 expression were also predictive of multi-organ failures and poor overall survival. Conclusion Our data indicated that miRNA expression profiles were significantly differentiated between the icteric and anicteric groups. Serum miR-601 and miR-630 at presentation could potentially serve as promising biomarkers for predicting subsequent acute liver failure and overall survival in patients with leptospirosis.",
