                "abstracts": "© 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved. For permissions, e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Background: The influence of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on the composition of gut microbiota in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is unclear. Methods: We enrolled 62 patients with HCV monoinfection and 24 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection receiving elbasvir-grazoprevir from a clinical trial. Fecal specimens collected before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment were analyzed using amplicon-based 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Results: Sustained virological response rates in the monoinfection and coinfection groups were similar (98.4% vs 95.8%). Pretreatment bacterial communities in the patient groups were less diverse and distinct from those of healthy controls. Compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals showed comparable microbial alpha diversity but decreased Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratios. The improvement of microbial dysbiosis was observed in responders achieving sustained virological response across fibrosis stages but was not found in nonresponders. Responders with a low degree of fibrosis exhibited a recovery in alpha diversity to levels comparable to those in healthy controls. Reciprocal alterations of increased beneficial bacteria and reduced pathogenic bacteria were also observed in responders. Conclusions: This study indicates a short-term effect of direct-acting antivirals in restoration of microbial dysbiosis. The favorable changes in gut microbiota profiles after viral eradication might contribute toward the reduction of HCV-related complications among infected individuals.",

Methods: We enrolled 62 patients with HCV monoinfection and 24 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection receiving elbasvir-grazoprevir from a clinical trial. Fecal specimens collected before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment were analyzed using amplicon-based 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Results: Sustained virological response rates in the monoinfection and coinfection groups were similar (98.4% vs 95.8%). Pretreatment bacterial communities in the patient groups were less diverse and distinct from those of healthy controls. Compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals showed comparable microbial alpha diversity but decreased Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratios. The improvement of microbial dysbiosis was observed in responders achieving sustained virological response across fibrosis stages but was not found in nonresponders. Responders with a low degree of fibrosis exhibited a recovery in alpha diversity to levels comparable to those in healthy controls. Reciprocal alterations of increased beneficial bacteria and reduced pathogenic bacteria were also observed in responders. Conclusions: This study indicates a short-term effect of direct-acting antivirals in restoration of microbial dysbiosis. The favorable changes in gut microbiota profiles after viral eradication might contribute toward the reduction of HCV-related complications among infected individuals.",
