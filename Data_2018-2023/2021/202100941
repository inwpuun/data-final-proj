                "abstracts": "© 2021Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is an emerging flavivirus that causes severe disease in avian hosts, while also affecting mammalian hosts; however, information on viral interaction with mosquito vectors for mammalian hosts is limited. Vector competence of Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes for DTMUV were investigated. Both Aedes mosquito species were orally infected with DK/TH/CU-1 strain of Thai DTMUV and isolated DTMUV from BALB/c mouse. Genomes of the viruses isolated from hosts and vectors were analyzed and compared with the positive virus. Findings showed that both Aedes mosquito species could serve as vectors for DTMUV with minimum viral titer in blood meal of 106 TCID50/mL. After taking blood meal with viral titer at 107 TCID50/mL, vector competence of the mosquitoes was significantly different from the lower titer in both species. Both Aedes species did not support development of the isolated viruses from mouse. A point mutation of nucleotide and amino acid was found in all isolated DTMUV from Ae. aegypti saliva, while other viruses were similar to the positive virus. Our findings demonstrated that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus had potential to transmit the virus and play important roles in the viral transmission cycle in mammalian hosts, while viral mutation occurred in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.",

Vector competence of Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes for DTMUV were investigated. Both Aedes mosquito species were orally infected with DK/TH/CU-1 strain of Thai DTMUV and isolated DTMUV from BALB/c mouse. Genomes of the viruses isolated from hosts and vectors were analyzed and compared with the positive virus. Findings showed that both Aedes mosquito species could serve as vectors for DTMUV with minimum viral titer in blood meal of 106 TCID50/mL. After taking blood meal with viral titer at 107 TCID50/mL, vector competence of the mosquitoes was significantly different from the lower titer in both species. Both Aedes species did not support development of the isolated viruses from mouse. A point mutation of nucleotide and amino acid was found in all isolated DTMUV from Ae. aegypti saliva, while other viruses were similar to the positive virus. Our findings demonstrated that both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus had potential to transmit the virus and play important roles in the viral transmission cycle in mammalian hosts, while viral mutation occurred in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.",
