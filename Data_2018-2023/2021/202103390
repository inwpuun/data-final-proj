            "xocs:funding-text": "In an interview with venture capital executives who have experience in startup valuation in seed to series level more than 10 years, we find that venture capital is more likely to invest in growing startups. Selected startups often have substantial customers using their products or services, which are pre-series A stage - series A stage startups. Venture capital has a strategic investment strategy that provides good advice on managing finances, entering markets, and building a client base for selected startups. The existing sources of funds in Thailand have a large amount of investment. Each source of funds has different investment goals. However, most of the funds are available for startups in the pre-series A stage - series A stage and above. Likewise, with startups that are divided into multiple stages, in order to receive series A stage funding, it is necessary to start from the seed stage. Startups in the seed stage receive funding from investors who look for startups in the seed stage. In the event that a startup in the seed stage requires more capital, it is necessary to move from the seed stage to a higher stage. Most of the investments come from corporate venture capital account for more than 80% of the total investment in the system, rarely choose to invest in startups at the seed stage and often choose to invest in startups at pre-series A stage to series A stage. Interviewees suggested that seed-stage startups should start raising funds from the government grant, where it is not difficult to find, but the fund is smaller than the higher-stage investor group. The funds received from the government grant are usually not more than 3 - 5 million baht. However, only the short-list startups in the focus industry are funded by the government grant. Government funding agencies often ignore funding the previous-funded startups. Government funding agencies tend to ignore the well-funded startups; as a result, the previous-funded startup cannot level up to from seed stage to series A stage due to the lack of support.",

Key elements are funding type, founder\u2019s character, education and experience, domain knowledge, unfair advantage, traction, social network, information asymmetry, market response and supportive ecosystem. Research Limitations/Implications: This study is derived from interviews from only 1 CVC and 3 startups so the further research by other methodology (quantitative) with the samples from other funders and startups in several industries are recommended. Practical Implications: Literature\u2019s review is performed in the area of startup fundraising, patterns and key success factors from internal and external factors which lead to the successful fundraising.
