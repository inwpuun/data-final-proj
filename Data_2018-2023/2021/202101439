                "abstracts": "© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbHOverall efficiency of cell reprogramming for porcine fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is currently poor, and few cell lines have been established. This study examined gene expression during early phase of cellular reprogramming in the relationship to the iPSC colony morphology and in vitro pluripotent characteristics. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. Two different colony morphologies referred to either compact (n = 10) or loose (n = 10) colonies were further examined for proliferative activity, gene expression and in vitro pluripotency. A total of 1,697 iPSC-like colonies (2.34%) were observed after gene transduction. The compact colonies contained with tightly packed cells with a distinct-clear border between the colony and feeder cells, while loose colonies demonstrated irregular colony boundary. For quantitative expression of genes responsible for early phase cell reprogramming, the Dppa2 and EpCAM were significantly upregulated while NR0B1 was downregulated in compact colonies compared with loose phenotype (p <.05). Higher proportion of compact iPSC phenotype (5 of 10, 50%) could be maintained in undifferentiated state for more than 50 passages compared unfavourably with loose morphology (3 of 10, 30%). All iPS cell lines obtained from these two types of colony morphologies expressed pluripotent genes and proteins (OCT4, NANOG and E-cadherin). In addition, they could aggregate and form three-dimensional structure of embryoid bodies. However, only compact iPSC colonies differentiated into three germ layers. Molecular signature of early phase of cell reprogramming coupled with primary colony morphology reflected the in vitro pluripotency of porcine iPSCs. These findings can be simply applied for pre-screening selection of the porcine iPSC cell line.",

This study examined gene expression during early phase of cellular reprogramming in the relationship to the iPSC colony morphology and in vitro pluripotent characteristics. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. Two different colony morphologies referred to either compact (n = 10) or loose (n = 10) colonies were further examined for proliferative activity, gene expression and in vitro pluripotency. A total of 1,697 iPSC-like colonies (2.34%) were observed after gene transduction. The compact colonies contained with tightly packed cells with a distinct-clear border between the colony and feeder cells, while loose colonies demonstrated irregular colony boundary. For quantitative expression of genes responsible for early phase cell reprogramming, the Dppa2 and EpCAM were significantly upregulated while NR0B1 was downregulated in compact colonies compared with loose phenotype (p <.05). Higher proportion of compact iPSC phenotype (5 of 10, 50%) could be maintained in undifferentiated state for more than 50 passages compared unfavourably with loose morphology (3 of 10, 30%). All iPS cell lines obtained from these two types of colony morphologies expressed pluripotent genes and proteins (OCT4, NANOG and E-cadherin). In addition, they could aggregate and form three-dimensional structure of embryoid bodies. However, only compact iPSC colonies differentiated into three germ layers. Molecular signature of early phase of cell reprogramming coupled with primary colony morphology reflected the in vitro pluripotency of porcine iPSCs. These findings can be simply applied for pre-screening selection of the porcine iPSC cell line.",
