                "abstracts": "© 2021 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.Background Unintentional weight loss (UWL) is defined as unintentional reduction of more than 5% of baseline body weight over 6 to 12 months. UWL is a common problem in the older adults, resulting in increased rate of morbidity and mortality. With specific reference to Thailand, no information on factors associated with UWL in older adults could be traced. The aims of this research were to identify the factors associated with UWL and to assess the common causes of UWL among older adults in the geriatric outpatient clinic of university hospital. Methods A case-control study was conducted from June 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2020. Eighty older adults aged 60 years or older were enrolled in the UWL group while the non-UWL group consisted of 160 participants. Data collection was performed by structural questionnaire including baseline characteristics, psychosocial factors, health information, lifestyle behaviors, and medications. The factors associated with UWL were analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Causes of UWL were recorded from electronic medical records. Results The mean age of the 240 participants was 79.6 years (SD 7.4). Most patients were female (79.2%) and had fewer than 12 years of education (62.6%). The three common causes of UWL were reduced appetite (20.1%), dementia and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (13.7%) and medications (11.0%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of >1 (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.37\u20134.73; P = 0.003), vitamin D deficiency (OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.62\u20139.97; P = 0.003), and hemoglobin level of <12 g/dL (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.32\u20134.63; P = 0.005) were factors significantly associated with UWL. Conclusions Factors associated with UWL were CCI score >1, vitamin D deficiency, and hemoglobin level of <12 g/dl. The early detection of these associated factors, reduced appetite, dementia and polypharmacy may be important in UWL prevention in older adults.",

        "dc:description": "Background Unintentional weight loss (UWL) is defined as unintentional reduction of more than 5% of baseline body weight over 6 to 12 months. UWL is a common problem in the older adults, resulting in increased rate of morbidity and mortality. With specific reference to Thailand, no information on factors associated with UWL in older adults could be traced. The aims of this research were to identify the factors associated with UWL and to assess the common causes of UWL among older adults in the geriatric outpatient clinic of university hospital. Methods A case-control study was conducted from June 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2020. Eighty older adults aged 60 years or older were enrolled in the UWL group while the non-UWL group consisted of 160 participants. Data collection was performed by structural questionnaire including baseline characteristics, psychosocial factors, health information, lifestyle behaviors, and medications. The factors associated with UWL were analyzed by using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Causes of UWL were recorded from electronic medical records. Results The mean age of the 240 participants was 79.6 years (SD 7.4). Most patients were female (79.2%) and had fewer than 12 years of education (62.6%). The three common causes of UWL were reduced appetite (20.1%), dementia and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (13.7%) and medications (11.0%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of >1 (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.37\u20134.73; P = 0.003), vitamin D deficiency (OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.62\u20139.97; P = 0.003), and hemoglobin level of <12 g/dL (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.32\u20134.63; P = 0.005) were factors significantly associated with UWL. Conclusions Factors associated with UWL were CCI score >1, vitamin D deficiency, and hemoglobin level of <12 g/dl. The early detection of these associated factors, reduced appetite, dementia and polypharmacy may be important in UWL prevention in older adults.",
