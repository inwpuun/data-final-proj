Not only on health issue, but other aspects which are unavoidably involved are environment, economics, politics, social and the new way of living. This new normal way of life certainly influences medical practice. The physicians of every expertise should acquire additional knowledge and be competent in taking care of an individual, patients, and even themselves to stay safe from the deadly virus. Some health technologies have been rapidly emerging to serve the needs of the world. A distinct example is COVID-19 vaccine invention, manufacturing, and distribution. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or new technology of Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines against the COVID-19 had extremely expedited production process and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval like it has never been before. Another example is a digital health which has been introduced for quite a while. A steep and expanding growth of various digital health technologies and artificial intelligence is more widely accepted and practiced e.g. telemedicine, health data sharing, medical applications, and etc. These digital health technologies are also incorporated with many business start-ups to serve necessities to live in a new way of life. The effects of COVID-19 to obstetrics and gynecology practices are also evidenced in both tangible and intangible aspects: safety issues related to the infection (medical care providers/ hospital management vs women/patients/ her family members), health outcomes (reproduction, perinatal, cancer), selective type of service (elective vs urgent vs emergent), education and training (face-to-face vs online), a balance of specialties needed now and in the upcoming future (reproductive endocrinologist, obstetricians, gynecologic oncologists), and etc. All of us, as a physician or as an individual, should stay safe, have knowledge and strength to sail safely through the virus-inducing storm.",

        "dc:description": "The pandemic COVID-19 certainly has terrible impact to the world. Not only on health issue, but other aspects which are unavoidably involved are environment, economics, politics, social and the new way of living. This new normal way of life certainly influences medical practice. The physicians of every expertise should acquire additional knowledge and be competent in taking care of an individual, patients, and even themselves to stay safe from the deadly virus. Some health technologies have been rapidly emerging to serve the needs of the world. A distinct example is COVID-19 vaccine invention, manufacturing, and distribution. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or new technology of Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines against the COVID-19 had extremely expedited production process and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval like it has never been before. Another example is a digital health which has been introduced for quite a while. A steep and expanding growth of various digital health technologies and artificial intelligence is more widely accepted and practiced e.g. telemedicine, health data sharing, medical applications, and etc. These digital health technologies are also incorporated with many business start-ups to serve necessities to live in a new way of life. The effects of COVID-19 to obstetrics and gynecology practices are also evidenced in both tangible and intangible aspects: safety issues related to the infection (medical care providers/ hospital management vs women/patients/ her family members), health outcomes (reproduction, perinatal, cancer), selective type of service (elective vs urgent vs emergent), education and training (face-to-face vs online), a balance of specialties needed now and in the upcoming future (reproductive endocrinologist, obstetricians, gynecologic oncologists), and etc. All of us, as a physician or as an individual, should stay safe, have knowledge and strength to sail safely through the virus-inducing storm.",
