The study found that (1) the problems regarding music education in Thailand were lack of experts, lack of music curriculum, lack of musical instruments and proper classrooms, administration systems, lack of budget, lack of music-related activities and disagreement in the perceptions of school directors and teachers; and (2) under the OBEC, there were 30,112 schools in total with 6,781,130 students in the 2018 academic year. As for music teachers, the majority, 68.9%, possess an educational background in music or music education. Overall, most of the schools of all sizes tend to lack Thai, Western and Thai folk musical instruments.",

The study found that (1) the problems regarding music education in Thailand were lack of experts, lack of music curriculum, lack of musical instruments and proper classrooms, administration systems, lack of budget, lack of music-related activities and disagreement in the perceptions of school directors and teachers; and (2) under the OBEC, there were 30,112 schools in total with 6,781,130 students in the 2018 academic year. As for music teachers, the majority, 68.9%, possess an educational background in music or music education. Overall, most of the schools of all sizes tend to lack Thai, Western and Thai folk musical instruments.",
