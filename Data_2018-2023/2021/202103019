                "abstracts": "© 2021 Newswood Limited. All rights reserved.Organic fresh milk has higher nutrition than conventional milk, with the former consisting of n-3 fatty acids, iron, carotenoid, less iodine, and high protein. These are the results of organic farming, which is different from traditional agriculture in terms of farm preparation, feed, dairy health, and organic milk processing standards. However, there are limited studies in Thailand and Japan on organic fresh milk from the customer perspective to support one function of the organic fresh milk system. This study aims to fill in this gap. Researchers conducted the developed questionnaires with 418 samples in Thailand and 432 samples in Japan. This study examines attitudes toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of willingness to purchase organic fresh milk. The collected data was analyzed using a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model. The results showed that attitudes toward behavior and subjective norms are associated with willingness to purchase organic fresh milk. Package labeling also has a strong influence on perception. Especially during the COVID-19 crisis, healthy consumption and lifestyle had a positive effect toward the purchase of organic fresh milk. Social media also affects subjective norms correlated with willingness to purchase such milk. However, one\u2019s perceived behavioral control for willingness to purchase organic fresh milk in Thailand is not significant, whereas in Japan it is.",

These are the results of organic farming, which is different from traditional agriculture in terms of farm preparation, feed, dairy health, and organic milk processing standards. However, there are limited studies in Thailand and Japan on organic fresh milk from the customer perspective to support one function of the organic fresh milk system. This study aims to fill in this gap. Researchers conducted the developed questionnaires with 418 samples in Thailand and 432 samples in Japan. This study examines attitudes toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of willingness to purchase organic fresh milk. The collected data was analyzed using a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model. The results showed that attitudes toward behavior and subjective norms are associated with willingness to purchase organic fresh milk. Package labeling also has a strong influence on perception. Especially during the COVID-19 crisis, healthy consumption and lifestyle had a positive effect toward the purchase of organic fresh milk. Social media also affects subjective norms correlated with willingness to purchase such milk. However, one\u2019s perceived behavioral control for willingness to purchase organic fresh milk in Thailand is not significant, whereas in Japan it is.",
