The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Lao PDR as part of the Greater Mekong Subregion for tourism development, particularly border cities like Savannakhet. The planned initiative for tourism development is to support investment for ecotourism and handicraft production. 4. Threats: T Threats were identified in various ways as follows: Insufficiently continuous financial support: A shortage of financial resources is one of the threats to the development of tourism in Savannakhet. Most tourism development projects have depended on funding from foreign external organizations. The province has not yet become well-known to foreign tourism investors to contribute to investing, constructing tourism facilities and operating services. Although the number of tourism facilities have increased steadily, they are not sufficient to serve a large number of visitors when the ASEAN community is fully deployed.",

                "abstracts": "© 2021, Khon Kaen University. All rights reserved.Tourism growth acts as a significant tool in supporting economic development and poverty alleviation of developing countries, such as Lao PDR. Savannakhet, one of the country\u2019s top three most-visited provinces, was the focus of this study. Despite its record of good tourism growth over the last few decades, this province was chosen by only a small percentage of travelers as their final destination with overnight stops. The present study investigated tourism growth in Savannakhet, major factors influencing tourism growth, and tourist motivation to visit this province. The mixed-method approach was used to elicit quantitative and qualitative data which were collected through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and questionnaires. The results show that Savannakhet is ideally located in the center of the Mekong sub-region. With overland transport corridors and the Second Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, Savannakhet has benefited from the growth of trade, investments, and tourism. The major motivations for tourists to travel to Savannakhet are its location, a culture similar culture to that of its neighbors, relaxation, and a gateway. However, most tourist locations in Savannakhet, according to SWOT analysis, still lack dominant attractiveness, sufficient tourism packages, tour operators, and supportive public transportation. Our findings suggest several strategies for tourism development in Savannakhet to draw more tourists from both domestic and international levels by improving its infrastructure and services in tourism sectors, strengthening community-based tourism, and developing creative tourism.",

Savannakhet, one of the country\u2019s top three most-visited provinces, was the focus of this study. Despite its record of good tourism growth over the last few decades, this province was chosen by only a small percentage of travelers as their final destination with overnight stops. The present study investigated tourism growth in Savannakhet, major factors influencing tourism growth, and tourist motivation to visit this province. The mixed-method approach was used to elicit quantitative and qualitative data which were collected through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and questionnaires. The results show that Savannakhet is ideally located in the center of the Mekong sub-region. With overland transport corridors and the Second Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, Savannakhet has benefited from the growth of trade, investments, and tourism. The major motivations for tourists to travel to Savannakhet are its location, a culture similar culture to that of its neighbors, relaxation, and a gateway. However, most tourist locations in Savannakhet, according to SWOT analysis, still lack dominant attractiveness, sufficient tourism packages, tour operators, and supportive public transportation. Our findings suggest several strategies for tourism development in Savannakhet to draw more tourists from both domestic and international levels by improving its infrastructure and services in tourism sectors, strengthening community-based tourism, and developing creative tourism.",
