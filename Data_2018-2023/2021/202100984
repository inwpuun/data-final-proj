                "abstracts": "© 2021 American Academy of PeriodontologyBackground: Studies support the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and periodontitis. However, age is the major confounding factor for both conditions. Therefore, this cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in different Thai adult age groups. Methods: Data on the medical history, medical examination, and full mouth oral examination of 5,690 Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand employees aged 25 to 77 years were collected. The prevalence ratio (PR) between risk variables, MetS, and periodontitis was determined using Poisson regression analysis. Moreover, the subgroup analysis and effect modification by age on severe periodontitis were performed. Results: Overall, MetS was significantly associated with severe periodontitis compared with non-severe periodontitis (adjusted PR, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.13). The association was modified by age, with negative effect modification observed on the multiplicative and additive scales. The subgroup analysis revealed a significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis only in participants aged <45 years with an adjusted PR of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.29 to 2.21). All MetS components, except hypertension, were associated with severe periodontitis in this group. Conclusions: There is a significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in adults aged <45 years. Therefore, attempts to control the risk of MetS and periodontitis should be emphasized for early adults to reduce the incidence of these conditions and related complications when they become elderly.",

Therefore, this cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in different Thai adult age groups. Methods: Data on the medical history, medical examination, and full mouth oral examination of 5,690 Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand employees aged 25 to 77 years were collected. The prevalence ratio (PR) between risk variables, MetS, and periodontitis was determined using Poisson regression analysis. Moreover, the subgroup analysis and effect modification by age on severe periodontitis were performed. Results: Overall, MetS was significantly associated with severe periodontitis compared with non-severe periodontitis (adjusted PR, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.13). The association was modified by age, with negative effect modification observed on the multiplicative and additive scales. The subgroup analysis revealed a significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis only in participants aged <45 years with an adjusted PR of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.29 to 2.21). All MetS components, except hypertension, were associated with severe periodontitis in this group. Conclusions: There is a significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in adults aged <45 years. Therefore, attempts to control the risk of MetS and periodontitis should be emphasized for early adults to reduce the incidence of these conditions and related complications when they become elderly.",
