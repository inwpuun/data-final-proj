                "abstracts": "© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.Elicitors that trigger the defense mechanism of plants could be a promising approach for elevating the bioactive compounds in tissue-cultured plant suspension cells. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salicylic acid (SA), chitosan (CHI) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) elicitation applied at different concentrations to suspension cells of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica (PM) on the contents of isoflavonoid, antioxidant, and antiaging activities. Six standards of isoflavonoids, namely, daidzein, genistein, daidzin, genistin, khwakhurin and puerarin, were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To our knowledge, SA elicitation was first reported in this study and showed the highest accumulation of daidzein (2.37 mg/g DW), khwakhurin (1.05 mg/g DW), genistin (0.14 mg/g DW) and puerarin (5.13 mg/g DW). CHI elicitation gave favorable results, and the amounts of daidzein, genistein, khwakhurin and puerarin quantified were 2.24, 0.29, 1.04, and 1.80 mg/g DW, respectively. MeJA elicitation was the least effective method of all three elicitors. The results from DPPH-based assays suggested that extract from SA elicitation had the greatest antioxidant activity, followed by nonelicited cells (control), CHI, and MeJA elicitation. We also further evaluated the biological activities of PM extracts with elicitors on human dermal fibroblasts. We found that salicylic acid is the most promising elicitor to enhance the biological activities of PM extracts. The PM extract from SA-elicited cells promoted the proliferation of fibroblasts by approximately 20%. Furthermore, pretreatment with SA-elicited extract can prevent fibroblasts from experiencing oxidative insults, such as H2O2. The pharmacological data on fibroblasts support the antioxidant activities, implying the antiaging activities of PM extract. Taken together, our study clearly supports the potential utility of cell suspension culture of PM in the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries to enhance the production of isoflavonoids and other active components.",

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salicylic acid (SA), chitosan (CHI) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) elicitation applied at different concentrations to suspension cells of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica (PM) on the contents of isoflavonoid, antioxidant, and antiaging activities. Six standards of isoflavonoids, namely, daidzein, genistein, daidzin, genistin, khwakhurin and puerarin, were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To our knowledge, SA elicitation was first reported in this study and showed the highest accumulation of daidzein (2.37 mg/g DW), khwakhurin (1.05 mg/g DW), genistin (0.14 mg/g DW) and puerarin (5.13 mg/g DW). CHI elicitation gave favorable results, and the amounts of daidzein, genistein, khwakhurin and puerarin quantified were 2.24, 0.29, 1.04, and 1.80 mg/g DW, respectively. MeJA elicitation was the least effective method of all three elicitors. The results from DPPH-based assays suggested that extract from SA elicitation had the greatest antioxidant activity, followed by nonelicited cells (control), CHI, and MeJA elicitation. We also further evaluated the biological activities of PM extracts with elicitors on human dermal fibroblasts. We found that salicylic acid is the most promising elicitor to enhance the biological activities of PM extracts. The PM extract from SA-elicited cells promoted the proliferation of fibroblasts by approximately 20%. Furthermore, pretreatment with SA-elicited extract can prevent fibroblasts from experiencing oxidative insults, such as H2O2. The pharmacological data on fibroblasts support the antioxidant activities, implying the antiaging activities of PM extract. Taken together, our study clearly supports the potential utility of cell suspension culture of PM in the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries to enhance the production of isoflavonoids and other active components.",
