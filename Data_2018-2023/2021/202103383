                "abstracts": "© 2021 Oludoye et al.Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the roles of stakeholders on cocoa farmers\u2019 safe pesticide use in Nigeria using the socio-ecological model as the theoretical framework. Methods: This was a cross-sectional qualitative study where participants were purposefully selected based on some criteria. Then, they were interviewed in-depth using a semi- structured interview approach. The interview guide was designed based on other literature and the study objectives. The interview transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the content analysis technique. Results: In all, 57 participants were involved in the interview process across all the study locations. Five layers of influence (cocoa farmers, pesticide retailers, extension officers, pesticide importers and government agencies) were considered. At individual level, cocoa farmers complained about lack of information from other stakeholders regarding pesticide use except retailers due to the farmers\u2019 proximity to their stores. However, pesticide safety information from the retailers were found to be inadequate due to their interest in financial gains rather than a focus on human health and the environment. Additionally, most retailers had no understanding about the characteristics of products they sold as they could not read pesticide labels. Furthermore, lack of motivations, human resources and facilities hindered effective extension education in the rural communities. Also, pesticide importers took efforts to train the farmers within their network, but majority of these trainings focused on lead farmers who were expected to disseminate the information to others. Besides, the agencies did organize training or workshop sometimes, but it was inadequate due to budget constraint. Lastly, environmental or agri-policies relating to Nigerian cocoa farmers concerning safe pesticide use and disposal were also inadequate. Conclusion: Generally, there was a large information gap with respect to pesticide safety between cocoa farmers and other stakeholders which undermined pesticide use safety. This study highlighted the need for government agencies in Nigeria to develop mechanisms to monitor information exchange among other stakeholders and cocoa farmers with respect to safe pesticide use and disposal.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the roles of stakeholders on cocoa farmers\u2019 safe pesticide use in Nigeria using the socio-ecological model as the theoretical framework. Methods: This was a cross-sectional qualitative study where participants were purposefully selected based on some criteria. Then, they were interviewed in-depth using a semi- structured interview approach. The interview guide was designed based on other literature and the study objectives. The interview transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the content analysis technique. Results: In all, 57 participants were involved in the interview process across all the study locations. Five layers of influence (cocoa farmers, pesticide retailers, extension officers, pesticide importers and government agencies) were considered. At individual level, cocoa farmers complained about lack of information from other stakeholders regarding pesticide use except retailers due to the farmers\u2019 proximity to their stores. However, pesticide safety information from the retailers were found to be inadequate due to their interest in financial gains rather than a focus on human health and the environment. Additionally, most retailers had no understanding about the characteristics of products they sold as they could not read pesticide labels. Furthermore, lack of motivations, human resources and facilities hindered effective extension education in the rural communities. Also, pesticide importers took efforts to train the farmers within their network, but majority of these trainings focused on lead farmers who were expected to disseminate the information to others. Besides, the agencies did organize training or workshop sometimes, but it was inadequate due to budget constraint. Lastly, environmental or agri-policies relating to Nigerian cocoa farmers concerning safe pesticide use and disposal were also inadequate. Conclusion: Generally, there was a large information gap with respect to pesticide safety between cocoa farmers and other stakeholders which undermined pesticide use safety. This study highlighted the need for government agencies in Nigeria to develop mechanisms to monitor information exchange among other stakeholders and cocoa farmers with respect to safe pesticide use and disposal.",
