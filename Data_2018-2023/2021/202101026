                "abstracts": "© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe high density and viscosity of fuel oil leads to its prolonged persistence in the environment and causes widespread contamination. Dispersants with a low environmental impact are necessary for fuel oil spill remediation. This study aimed to formulate bio-based dispersants by mixing anionic biosurfactant (lipopeptides from Bacillus subtilis GY19) with nonionic oleochemical surfactant (Dehydol LS7TH). The synergistic effect of the anionic-nonionic surfactant mixture produced a Winsor Type III microemulsion, which promoted petroleum mobilization. The hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD) equations for ionic and nonionic surfactant mixtures were compared, and it was found that the ionic equation was applicable for the calculation of lipopeptides and Dehydol LS7TH concentrations. The best formula contained 6.6% w/v lipopeptides and 11.9% w/v Dehydol LS7TH in seawater, and its dispersion effectiveness for bunker fuels A and C was 92% and 78%, respectively. The application of bio-based dispersants in water sources was optimized by Box-Behnken design. The efficiency of the bio-based dispersant was affected by the dispersant-to-oil ratios (DORs) but not by the water salinity. A suitable range of DORs for different oil contamination levels could be identified from the response surface plot. The dispersed fuel oil was further degraded by adding an oil-degrading bacterial consortium to the chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAFs). After 7 days of incubation, the concentration of fuel oil was reduced from 3692 mg/L to 356 mg/L (88% removal efficiency). On the other hand, the abiotic control removed less than 40% fuel oil from the CEWAFs. This bio-based dispersant had an efficiency comparable to that of a commercial dispersant. The process of dispersant formulation and optimization could be applied to other surfactant mixtures.",

        "dc:description": "The high density and viscosity of fuel oil leads to its prolonged persistence in the environment and causes widespread contamination. Dispersants with a low environmental impact are necessary for fuel oil spill remediation. This study aimed to formulate bio-based dispersants by mixing anionic biosurfactant (lipopeptides from Bacillus subtilis GY19) with nonionic oleochemical surfactant (Dehydol LS7TH). The synergistic effect of the anionic-nonionic surfactant mixture produced a Winsor Type III microemulsion, which promoted petroleum mobilization. The hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD) equations for ionic and nonionic surfactant mixtures were compared, and it was found that the ionic equation was applicable for the calculation of lipopeptides and Dehydol LS7TH concentrations. The best formula contained 6.6% w/v lipopeptides and 11.9% w/v Dehydol LS7TH in seawater, and its dispersion effectiveness for bunker fuels A and C was 92% and 78%, respectively. The application of bio-based dispersants in water sources was optimized by Box-Behnken design. The efficiency of the bio-based dispersant was affected by the dispersant-to-oil ratios (DORs) but not by the water salinity. A suitable range of DORs for different oil contamination levels could be identified from the response surface plot. The dispersed fuel oil was further degraded by adding an oil-degrading bacterial consortium to the chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAFs). After 7 days of incubation, the concentration of fuel oil was reduced from 3692 mg/L to 356 mg/L (88% removal efficiency). On the other hand, the abiotic control removed less than 40% fuel oil from the CEWAFs. This bio-based dispersant had an efficiency comparable to that of a commercial dispersant. The process of dispersant formulation and optimization could be applied to other surfactant mixtures.",
