                "abstracts": "© 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.Objective:Statins play a critical role in reducing the elevated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) among people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, maintaining statin therapy is difficult and may be impeded further in PLHIV due to the risk of antiretroviral therapy (ART)/statin interactions. We estimated rates of statin discontinuation and reinitiation, and the percentage of days covered by statin use among PLHIV on ART, and investigated factors associated with these outcomes.Design:Observational cohort study.Methods:Clinical data from individuals attending the HIV-NAT Centre in Bangkok, Thailand between 2001 and 2020 were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, competing-risk regression, and generalized estimating equations. Discontinuation was defined as statin cessation lasting 90 days.Results:Data on 318 PLHIV were included. After 1, 3, and 5 years, 22.3, 50.8, and 61.1% had discontinued statin use, respectively. Among those who discontinued (n=178), 52.0% reinitiated statin use within 5 years. Factors associated with statin discontinuation were low education level, fewer concomitant medications, and lack of ASCVD. Factors associated with statin reinitiation were older age, diabetes, and high levels of LDL cholesterol. The adjusted mean percentage of days covered by a statin was 86.7, 61.1, and 58.1% in the 6 months prior to 1, 3, and 5 years of follow-up, respectively.Conclusion:Maintenance of statin therapy is poor among PLHIV on ART but is not associated with using contraindicated antiretroviral/statin combinations. A better understanding of statin use in PLHIV will aid clinicians treating individuals and policy makers designing interventions for population-level ASCVD risk reduction.",

        "dc:description": "Objective:Statins play a critical role in reducing the elevated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) among people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, maintaining statin therapy is difficult and may be impeded further in PLHIV due to the risk of antiretroviral therapy (ART)/statin interactions. We estimated rates of statin discontinuation and reinitiation, and the percentage of days covered by statin use among PLHIV on ART, and investigated factors associated with these outcomes.Design:Observational cohort study.Methods:Clinical data from individuals attending the HIV-NAT Centre in Bangkok, Thailand between 2001 and 2020 were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, competing-risk regression, and generalized estimating equations. Discontinuation was defined as statin cessation lasting 90 days.Results:Data on 318 PLHIV were included. After 1, 3, and 5 years, 22.3, 50.8, and 61.1% had discontinued statin use, respectively. Among those who discontinued (n=178), 52.0% reinitiated statin use within 5 years. Factors associated with statin discontinuation were low education level, fewer concomitant medications, and lack of ASCVD. Factors associated with statin reinitiation were older age, diabetes, and high levels of LDL cholesterol. The adjusted mean percentage of days covered by a statin was 86.7, 61.1, and 58.1% in the 6 months prior to 1, 3, and 5 years of follow-up, respectively.Conclusion:Maintenance of statin therapy is poor among PLHIV on ART but is not associated with using contraindicated antiretroviral/statin combinations. A better understanding of statin use in PLHIV will aid clinicians treating individuals and policy makers designing interventions for population-level ASCVD risk reduction.",
