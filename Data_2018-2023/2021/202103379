The research was carried out in 2 phases: Phase 1 Instrument Development and Phase 2 Quality Assessment. The participants consisted of 1,556 fourth-year nursing students in Year 2017 under the Office of the Higher Education Commission, Ministry of Education and Praboromarajchanok Institute for Health Workforce Development, Ministry of Public Health. The analysis of IOC, reliability and discriminant index and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed using SPSS and LISREL. The results are as follows: the IOC was between .71\u20131; the reliability values of nursing activity interests: realistic (R), investigative (I), artistic (A), social (S), enterprising (E) and conventional (C) were 0.79, 0.72, 0.90, 0.89, 0.83 and 0.89, respectively; the reliability values of nursing activity competencies: R, I, A, S, E and C were 0.84, 0.80, 0.86, 0.78, 0.86 and 0.91, respectively; the discriminant index was between .20\u2013.79. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis show that the nursing activity interest and competency measurement models were consistent with the empirical data (χ2 = 45.61, p < .05, df = 27, χ2 /df = 1.69, GFI = .99, AGFI = .98, RMR = .01, RMSEA = .02), which indicates that the model of the inventory was consistent with the empirical data.",

The research was carried out in 2 phases: Phase 1 Instrument Development and Phase 2 Quality Assessment. The participants consisted of 1,556 fourth-year nursing students in Year 2017 under the Office of the Higher Education Commission, Ministry of Education and Praboromarajchanok Institute for Health Workforce Development, Ministry of Public Health. The analysis of IOC, reliability and discriminant index and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed using SPSS and LISREL. The results are as follows: the IOC was between .71\u20131; the reliability values of nursing activity interests: realistic (R), investigative (I), artistic (A), social (S), enterprising (E) and conventional (C) were 0.79, 0.72, 0.90, 0.89, 0.83 and 0.89, respectively; the reliability values of nursing activity competencies: R, I, A, S, E and C were 0.84, 0.80, 0.86, 0.78, 0.86 and 0.91, respectively; the discriminant index was between .20\u2013.79. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis show that the nursing activity interest and competency measurement models were consistent with the empirical data (χ2 = 45.61, p < .05, df = 27, χ2 /df = 1.69, GFI = .99, AGFI = .98, RMR = .01, RMSEA = .02), which indicates that the model of the inventory was consistent with the empirical data.",
