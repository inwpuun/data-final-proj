All rights reserved.This research article examines the current situation of audiences in Thailand who attend non-mainstream contemporary theatre and dance, focusing on the barriers to building audiences for this type of performance. Mixed methods were used to collect data from various target groups, including qualitative methods like in-depth interviews, and focus groups for contemporary theatre and dance companies and arts spaces, and quantitative data gathered from audience questionnaires and surveys. The study revealed that many theatre and dance companies or groups run by artists often put more emphasis on their performance-making than on their organization or management. Such a production-centered emphasis often neglects the importance of two-way interaction between artists and audiences and shows insufficient appreciation of audiences in developing their performances and programs. The inattention of many performance companies or groups to their current and potential audiences and to techniques to build and develop them is widespread, but not universal. However, a few groups have worked to create and manage their performances based on audiences\u2019 perspectives, thus both removing barriers to performance participation as much as possible and motivating transactional relations with audiences. Audience responses from these companies has led to greater audience engagement and improved audience appreciation.",

Mixed methods were used to collect data from various target groups, including qualitative methods like in-depth interviews, and focus groups for contemporary theatre and dance companies and arts spaces, and quantitative data gathered from audience questionnaires and surveys. The study revealed that many theatre and dance companies or groups run by artists often put more emphasis on their performance-making than on their organization or management. Such a production-centered emphasis often neglects the importance of two-way interaction between artists and audiences and shows insufficient appreciation of audiences in developing their performances and programs. The inattention of many performance companies or groups to their current and potential audiences and to techniques to build and develop them is widespread, but not universal. However, a few groups have worked to create and manage their performances based on audiences\u2019 perspectives, thus both removing barriers to performance participation as much as possible and motivating transactional relations with audiences. Audience responses from these companies has led to greater audience engagement and improved audience appreciation.",
