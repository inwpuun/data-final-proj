The study does so by introducing and examining the influence of nonprofit boundary work during the CSC process. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on thirty-four interviews and qualitative fieldwork. It draws on a case analysis of a regional CSC between multiple organizations operating locally in the apparel industry of Bangladesh, a developing country. Findings: Scaffolding work in the CSC formation stage \u2013 performed by development agency implementers who construe boundaries \u2013 and sensitization work in the CSC implementation stage \u2013 performed by a non-governmental organization (NGO) implementers who blur and expand boundaries \u2013 emerge as two conceptual categories of nonprofit boundary work. This allows NGO implementers to identify and enable the agency of sustainability envoys or socially privileged individuals who capitalize on their social credentials to support female workers in the factory and in the community. Originality/value: The study offers novel insights into the CSC process. It contributes to the CSC literature and the literature on boundary work, with a focus on gender-focused sustainability initiatives for female workers in developing countries.",

In particular, I would like to thank prof. Kathleen Rehbein (Marquette University College of Business Administration) for her constructive comments on a previous version of this manuscript discussed during the SIM-ONE Junior Faculty Consortium at the 2019 Academy of Management conference in Boston (USA). I would also like to thank prof. Andreas Rasche (Copenhagen Business School), prof. Emilia Cederberg (Stockholm School of Economics) and Natalie Anita Bye (Stockholm School of Economics) for their detailed suggestions during the \u201cWork-in-Progress\u201d seminar organized by Mistra Centre for Sustainable Markets in October 2019 in Stockholm (Sweden). Finally, I am particularly indebted to the Centre for Social and Sustainable Innovation (CSSI) at the Gustavson School of Business (University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) where I was a post-doctoral fellow and conducted most of this research.

The study does so by introducing and examining the influence of nonprofit boundary work during the CSC process. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on thirty-four interviews and qualitative fieldwork. It draws on a case analysis of a regional CSC between multiple organizations operating locally in the apparel industry of Bangladesh, a developing country. Findings: Scaffolding work in the CSC formation stage \u2013 performed by development agency implementers who construe boundaries \u2013 and sensitization work in the CSC implementation stage \u2013 performed by a non-governmental organization (NGO) implementers who blur and expand boundaries \u2013 emerge as two conceptual categories of nonprofit boundary work. This allows NGO implementers to identify and enable the agency of sustainability envoys or socially privileged individuals who capitalize on their social credentials to support female workers in the factory and in the community. Originality/value: The study offers novel insights into the CSC process. It contributes to the CSC literature and the literature on boundary work, with a focus on gender-focused sustainability initiatives for female workers in developing countries.",
