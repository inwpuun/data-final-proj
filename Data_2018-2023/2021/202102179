The aim of this study was to evaluate the rebleeding rate after DBE. Methods: This retrospective review was conducted between January 2006 and July 2018, 166 patients with overt OGIB who underwent DBE were enrolled. Therapeutic intervention was defined as endoscopic treatment, embolization, or surgery. Primary outcome was rebleeding rate after DBE. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on their DBE; (1) positive DBE requiring therapeutic intervention (G1), (2) positive DBE without therapeutic intervention required (G2) and (3) negative DBE (G3). Cumulative incidence of rebleeding was estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Cox regression was used to assess the association of DBE with rebleeding risk. This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Results: Sixty-eight patients (41%) were categorized in G1, 34 patients (20%) in G2 and 64 patients (39%) in G3. Overall rebleeding occurred in 24 patients (15%). The cumulative incidence of rebleeding for G1 was the lowest. The 1-year and 2-year cumulative probability of developing rebleeding after DBE in G1 were 3.5% and 3.5%, 8.2% and 14.0% in G2, and 18.2% and 20.6% in G3, respectively (p = 0.02). After adjusting for bleeding severity and comorbidities, patients with positive DBE requiring therapeutic intervention had a significantly lower rate of rebleeding when compared with patients who did not receive intervention (hazard ratio 0.17; 95% CI 0.03\u20130.90). Conclusion: DBE-guided therapeutic intervention was associated with a lower risk of rebleeding when compared with those with negative and positive DBE without therapeutic intervention. One-fifth of patients with overt OGIB had false negative after DBE.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) provides both diagnosis and treatment in overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the rebleeding rate after DBE. Methods: This retrospective review was conducted between January 2006 and July 2018, 166 patients with overt OGIB who underwent DBE were enrolled. Therapeutic intervention was defined as endoscopic treatment, embolization, or surgery. Primary outcome was rebleeding rate after DBE. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on their DBE; (1) positive DBE requiring therapeutic intervention (G1), (2) positive DBE without therapeutic intervention required (G2) and (3) negative DBE (G3). Cumulative incidence of rebleeding was estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Cox regression was used to assess the association of DBE with rebleeding risk. This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Results: Sixty-eight patients (41%) were categorized in G1, 34 patients (20%) in G2 and 64 patients (39%) in G3. Overall rebleeding occurred in 24 patients (15%). The cumulative incidence of rebleeding for G1 was the lowest. The 1-year and 2-year cumulative probability of developing rebleeding after DBE in G1 were 3.5% and 3.5%, 8.2% and 14.0% in G2, and 18.2% and 20.6% in G3, respectively (p = 0.02). After adjusting for bleeding severity and comorbidities, patients with positive DBE requiring therapeutic intervention had a significantly lower rate of rebleeding when compared with patients who did not receive intervention (hazard ratio 0.17; 95% CI 0.03\u20130.90). Conclusion: DBE-guided therapeutic intervention was associated with a lower risk of rebleeding when compared with those with negative and positive DBE without therapeutic intervention. One-fifth of patients with overt OGIB had false negative after DBE.",
