                "abstracts": "© 2021, Department of Science and Technology. All rights reserved.Control of blood pressure because of poor adherence is a problem in the Philippines despite the implementation of medicine access programs. Patient education is utilized to address this problem; however, there is no published literature to evaluate this using a pooled data analysis. The objective of the study is to examine the effect of educational interventions on adherence and blood pressure. Eight databases were used to search for articles published from 2000\u20132020. Inclusion criteria specified the population as Filipino, 18 yr old and above, clinically diagnosed hypertension, and receiving treatment. Out of 1,514 articles, 10 articles were quality-assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, systematically reviewed, and analyzed using a random-effects model. Patient education is estimated to increase the standardized self-reported adherence to 0.869 (p < 0.05, I2 = 94.98%) and the proportion of adherent patients to 77.4% (p < 0.001, I2 = 78.92%). The mean decrease in systolic blood pressure is estimated to be \u201314.568 (p < 0.001, I2 = 0%) for studies with control group and \u201312.907 (p < 0.001, I2 = 83.56%) for quasi-experimental studies. For diastolic blood pressure, the estimated mean decrease is \u20135.412 (p <0.001, I2 = 0%) for studies with control group and \u20135.592 (p < 0.001, I2 = 58.6%) for quasi-experimental studies. Findings should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity, low-to moderate-quality of evidence, and methodological limitations. Despite this, the result suggests that educational interventions should be incorporated in the existing programs for further research using longitudinal study design using objective measures for medication adherence.",

        "dc:description": "Control of blood pressure because of poor adherence is a problem in the Philippines despite the implementation of medicine access programs. Patient education is utilized to address this problem; however, there is no published literature to evaluate this using a pooled data analysis. The objective of the study is to examine the effect of educational interventions on adherence and blood pressure. Eight databases were used to search for articles published from 2000\u20132020. Inclusion criteria specified the population as Filipino, 18 yr old and above, clinically diagnosed hypertension, and receiving treatment. Out of 1,514 articles, 10 articles were quality-assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, systematically reviewed, and analyzed using a random-effects model. Patient education is estimated to increase the standardized self-reported adherence to 0.869 (p < 0.05, I2 = 94.98%) and the proportion of adherent patients to 77.4% (p < 0.001, I2 = 78.92%). The mean decrease in systolic blood pressure is estimated to be \u201314.568 (p < 0.001, I2 = 0%) for studies with control group and \u201312.907 (p < 0.001, I2 = 83.56%) for quasi-experimental studies. For diastolic blood pressure, the estimated mean decrease is \u20135.412 (p <0.001, I2 = 0%) for studies with control group and \u20135.592 (p < 0.001, I2 = 58.6%) for quasi-experimental studies. Findings should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity, low-to moderate-quality of evidence, and methodological limitations. Despite this, the result suggests that educational interventions should be incorporated in the existing programs for further research using longitudinal study design using objective measures for medication adherence.",
