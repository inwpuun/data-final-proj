Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Identifying emerging technology trends from patents helps to understand the status of the technology commercialization or utilization. It could provide research insights leading to advanced technological innovations that stimulate socially responsible research to address human dietary and medical needs. However, few studies have investigated emerging chitosan applications using patents. In this study, we report the application of a patent bibliometric predictive intelligence (PBPI) model to identify emergent topics and technology convergence related to chitosan applications from patents in the International Patent Classification system. Text mining was used to extract patterns from 5001 patents and each term was assigned an emergent score, following which we traced growth patterns, examined relationships between IPCs, emergent topics, and patents using correlation analysis and principal component analysis, and conducted matrix and cluster mapping analysis to understand industrial applications and explore patterns of technological convergence. Five major terms emerged in association with ascending and newly emergent topics over the last 13 years: \u201cshelf life,\u201d \u201cantibacterial,\u201d \u201cgood safety,\u201d \u201cabsorbing water,\u201d and \u201cauxiliary materials.\u201d These topics were closely linked with research in the biomedical and food production and preservation industries. A network analysis indicated that \u201cantibacterial\u201d terms exhibited the highest degree of convergence, followed by \u201cshelf life.\u201d These findings can inform strategies to determine new directions for chitosan research.",

        "dc:description": "Identifying emerging technology trends from patents helps to understand the status of the technology commercialization or utilization. It could provide research insights leading to advanced technological innovations that stimulate socially responsible research to address human dietary and medical needs. However, few studies have investigated emerging chitosan applications using patents. In this study, we report the application of a patent bibliometric predictive intelligence (PBPI) model to identify emergent topics and technology convergence related to chitosan applications from patents in the International Patent Classification system. Text mining was used to extract patterns from 5001 patents and each term was assigned an emergent score, following which we traced growth patterns, examined relationships between IPCs, emergent topics, and patents using correlation analysis and principal component analysis, and conducted matrix and cluster mapping analysis to understand industrial applications and explore patterns of technological convergence. Five major terms emerged in association with ascending and newly emergent topics over the last 13 years: \u201cshelf life,\u201d \u201cantibacterial,\u201d \u201cgood safety,\u201d \u201cabsorbing water,\u201d and \u201cauxiliary materials.\u201d These topics were closely linked with research in the biomedical and food production and preservation industries. A network analysis indicated that \u201cantibacterial\u201d terms exhibited the highest degree of convergence, followed by \u201cshelf life.\u201d These findings can inform strategies to determine new directions for chitosan research.",
