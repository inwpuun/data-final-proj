                "abstracts": "© 2020 Elsevier LtdFicolin is classified as an immune related protein containing collagen-like and fibrinogen-related domain (FreD). In invertebrates, the functions of fibrinogen-related proteins (FrePs) are of importance to innate immunity. In this study, a FreP in the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon was identified and characterized. The PmFreP cDNA is 1,007 bp long with a 921 bp-open reading frame that encodes for 306 amino acids. The deduced PmFreP sequence consists of a signal peptide, an unknown region and the FreD. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PmFreP was clustered with fibrinogen-like proteins in crustaceans which was separated from vertebrate ficolin-like proteins. The deduced fibrinogen-like domain contains four conserved cysteine residues (Cys96, Cys127, Cys249, and Cys262) that are responsible for the formation of disulfide bridges. Gene expression analysis shows that Pmfrep is mainly expressed in the intestine and the expression is significantly upregulated after Vibrio harveyi and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. Recombinant PmFreP (rPmFreP) were successfully expressed and purified, and forms a trimeric structure as judged by native-PAGE. Bacterial binding assay showed that the rPmFreD can bind and agglutinate Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in the presence of calcium (Ca2+) ions. Moreover, the rPmFreP facilitates the clearance of V. harveyi in vivo. Overall, our results suggested that the PmFreP may serve as pattern recognition receptors implicated in shrimp innate immunity.",

        "dc:description": "Ficolin is classified as an immune related protein containing collagen-like and fibrinogen-related domain (FreD). In invertebrates, the functions of fibrinogen-related proteins (FrePs) are of importance to innate immunity. In this study, a FreP in the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon was identified and characterized. The PmFreP cDNA is 1,007 bp long with a 921 bp-open reading frame that encodes for 306 amino acids. The deduced PmFreP sequence consists of a signal peptide, an unknown region and the FreD. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PmFreP was clustered with fibrinogen-like proteins in crustaceans which was separated from vertebrate ficolin-like proteins. The deduced fibrinogen-like domain contains four conserved cysteine residues (Cys96, Cys127, Cys249, and Cys262) that are responsible for the formation of disulfide bridges. Gene expression analysis shows that Pmfrep is mainly expressed in the intestine and the expression is significantly upregulated after Vibrio harveyi and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. Recombinant PmFreP (rPmFreP) were successfully expressed and purified, and forms a trimeric structure as judged by native-PAGE. Bacterial binding assay showed that the rPmFreD can bind and agglutinate Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in the presence of calcium (Ca2+) ions. Moreover, the rPmFreP facilitates the clearance of V. harveyi in vivo. Overall, our results suggested that the PmFreP may serve as pattern recognition receptors implicated in shrimp innate immunity.",
