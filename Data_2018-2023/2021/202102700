EC system with the wine in KCl(aq)electrolyte (1.5 mol L−1) was employed removing the polymeric pigments with good recovery of 39 peaks from 64 peaks. The mechanisms mainly involve enrichment induced aggregation and reduction of the pigments at the cathode and the adsorption onto the EC sludge. The EC was further miniaturized employing two intercalated stainless steel spring electrodes at 9.0 V which allowed removal of >99% interference peak area from the pigments within 5 s. The recoveries of the target phenolic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid and ferulic acid) were within the range of 86-102%. The repeated analysis of these standards revealed <2 and ≤10% RSD of the intra-day and inter-day precisions, respectively. The linearities of their calibration curves were observed withR2> 0.99. Their method detection limits were within the range of 0.02-0.20 mg L−1",

EC system with the wine in KCl(aq)electrolyte (1.5 mol L−1) was employed removing the polymeric pigments with good recovery of 39 peaks from 64 peaks. The mechanisms mainly involve enrichment induced aggregation and reduction of the pigments at the cathode and the adsorption onto the EC sludge. The EC was further miniaturized employing two intercalated stainless steel spring electrodes at 9.0 V which allowed removal of >99% interference peak area from the pigments within 5 s. The recoveries of the target phenolic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid and ferulic acid) were within the range of 86-102%. The repeated analysis of these standards revealed <2 and ≤10% RSD of the intra-day and inter-day precisions, respectively. The linearities of their calibration curves were observed withR2> 0.99. Their method detection limits were within the range of 0.02-0.20 mg L−1",
