                "abstracts": "© 2021 The authors. All right reserved.This paper is an exploration of building lifespan, building characteristics, and operating expenses. The main objectives are to identify the building component lifespan, including architectural components and engineering components, to determine the pattern of building component replacement life cycle and to examine the relationship between building characteristics and facility operating expenses. The investigation was undertaken through a study of thirty-nine residential condominiums located in Bangkok. The expense data were collected through document searches and surveys with key juristic persons of each condominium. The building service life document was collected from international references and standards. The data were examined using cross-case analysis to identify the lifespan of the buildings and to identify the relationships between the condominium operating expenses and the characteristics of the buildings. It was found that the typical building replacements occur on a broad 60-year cycle that can be subdivided into several phases. Further findings indicate that a significant pattern of building component replacement shifts every two decades through the building lifespan. It was also found that the condominium operating expenses vary according to the building age and building characteristics. Direct variation, inverse variation, and joint variation from the characteristics of the condominium building can be identified. The findings add to the understanding of condominium operating expenses based on building characteristics. The study can provide a reference for consideration of building selection criteria and replacement plans, and for building budget planning based on age and building characteristics.",

The main objectives are to identify the building component lifespan, including architectural components and engineering components, to determine the pattern of building component replacement life cycle and to examine the relationship between building characteristics and facility operating expenses. The investigation was undertaken through a study of thirty-nine residential condominiums located in Bangkok. The expense data were collected through document searches and surveys with key juristic persons of each condominium. The building service life document was collected from international references and standards. The data were examined using cross-case analysis to identify the lifespan of the buildings and to identify the relationships between the condominium operating expenses and the characteristics of the buildings. It was found that the typical building replacements occur on a broad 60-year cycle that can be subdivided into several phases. Further findings indicate that a significant pattern of building component replacement shifts every two decades through the building lifespan. It was also found that the condominium operating expenses vary according to the building age and building characteristics. Direct variation, inverse variation, and joint variation from the characteristics of the condominium building can be identified. The findings add to the understanding of condominium operating expenses based on building characteristics. The study can provide a reference for consideration of building selection criteria and replacement plans, and for building budget planning based on age and building characteristics.",
