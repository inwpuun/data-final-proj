This article applies qualitative research methods, using various documents, interviews and focus groups. The results found that these guidelines are the learning processes which affect learning throughout one 's life. The guidelines for lifelong education management to mobilize learning communities in the social-cultural context of Thailand consists of these key components; lifelong education management guidelines; and the final products. Finally, lifelong education management guidelines could be used to promote and develop lifelong learning for learning community mobilization based on the social-cultural context in Thailand. It is anticipated that the findings will add meaningful information and practical guidelines for enhancing understanding of guidelines for lifelong education management to mobilize learning community in Thailand, and serve as a basic and comparative outcome for further research.",

This article applies qualitative research methods, using various documents, interviews and focus groups. The results found that these guidelines are the learning processes which affect learning throughout one 's life. The guidelines for lifelong education management to mobilize learning communities in the social-cultural context of Thailand consists of these key components; lifelong education management guidelines; and the final products. Finally, lifelong education management guidelines could be used to promote and develop lifelong learning for learning community mobilization based on the social-cultural context in Thailand. It is anticipated that the findings will add meaningful information and practical guidelines for enhancing understanding of guidelines for lifelong education management to mobilize learning community in Thailand, and serve as a basic and comparative outcome for further research.",
