                "abstracts": "© 2020Essential oils (EOs) from various aromatic herbs exhibit potent in vitro antimicrobial characteristics against several bacterial foodborne pathogens and have therefore been proposed as natural alternatives to antibiotic agents. However, oral administration of EOs has limited practicality because of their high volatility, odor, rapid decomposition, and poor bioavailability in the lower part of the intestines. The main objective of the present study was to develop and evaluate an innovative tool for targeted delivery and sustained release of EOs in the gastrointestinal tract by using a nano/microstructured hybrid composite system. Cinnamon oil was used as a plant-derived antimicrobial agent model to prepare the nanoparticles via the hot homogenization technique. The prepared nanoparticles were then encapsulated in microparticles using an alginate-calcium chloride system. Their stability was investigated in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. The particles were also physicochemically characterized and biologically evaluated as antibacterial agents against foodborne pathogens. Our results showed that under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, the nano/microstructured hybrid composite particles exhibited good gastric resistance and sustained release in intestinal fluids. They also exhibited excellent antibacterial characteristics against important foodborne pathogens, namely, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, S. enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae. In conclusion, the innovation reported in the present study is an improved formula of cinnamon oil that could serve as a promising candidate as an antibacterial bioproduct for decontamination of foodborne pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.",

However, oral administration of EOs has limited practicality because of their high volatility, odor, rapid decomposition, and poor bioavailability in the lower part of the intestines. The main objective of the present study was to develop and evaluate an innovative tool for targeted delivery and sustained release of EOs in the gastrointestinal tract by using a nano/microstructured hybrid composite system. Cinnamon oil was used as a plant-derived antimicrobial agent model to prepare the nanoparticles via the hot homogenization technique. The prepared nanoparticles were then encapsulated in microparticles using an alginate-calcium chloride system. Their stability was investigated in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. The particles were also physicochemically characterized and biologically evaluated as antibacterial agents against foodborne pathogens. Our results showed that under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, the nano/microstructured hybrid composite particles exhibited good gastric resistance and sustained release in intestinal fluids. They also exhibited excellent antibacterial characteristics against important foodborne pathogens, namely, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, S. enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholerae. In conclusion, the innovation reported in the present study is an improved formula of cinnamon oil that could serve as a promising candidate as an antibacterial bioproduct for decontamination of foodborne pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.",
