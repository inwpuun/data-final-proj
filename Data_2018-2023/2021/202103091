                "abstracts": "© 2021, The Authors.The noon break or lunch hour in Bangkok's central business district (CBD) is when pedestrians wander around for various activities and purposes, in addition to having a meal, within a limited time frame. It is the only break from their daily working routines for energy recovery or socializing, which, in turn, increases readiness to continue working in the afternoon. Commercial activities preferred by pedestrians during this break contribute to increased economic activity. Since pedestrian behavior depends on the cultural context, this research aims to understand Thai urban pedestrian culture that benefits the public, both socially and economically, and to investigate pedestrians' experience of the physical quality of their walking infrastructure, reflecting their preferences. According to the information gained from observation, a field survey of four hundred thirty observations, and descriptive statistics, the urban pedestrian culture in the CBD of Bangkok is a combination of various activities related to a way of life; 69.4% and 44.9% of observed pedestrians have secondary and tertiary purposes. These multi-purpose trips during lunch hours include having meals, shopping, recovery from work, socializing, and taking care of business or running errands. The routine of lunch outings declined only slightly after the start of the pandemic in early 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic level (81.8% compared to 94.9%). Socializing has strong presence in the culture; 90.5% of group outings occur at least once or twice a week. On the physical side, the walking infrastructure, mainly comprising sidewalks, is used for circulation and as a place for social and economic settings. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, pedestrians' concerns about the physical environment were divided into five groups, as follows: Cluster 1, people concerned about thermal comfort, surface conditions, and sidewalk obstructions. Cluster 2, people concerned about thermal comfort and walking distance. Cluster 3, people concerned about level changes and walking distance. Cluster 4, people concerned about surface conditions and sidewalk obstructions. Lastly, cluster 5, people concerned about sidewalk obstructions, traffic safety, and level changes. In conclusion. significant problems experienced or causing concern to pedestrians include sidewalk obstructions of flow due to insufficient width of the walking space as well as blockages caused by utility infrastructure, or social or economic activities, walking distance, surface conditions of sidewalks, level changes, thermal comfort, and traffic safety, respectively. These experiences and concerns reflect pedestrians' preference for better quality of walking infrastructure. Therefore, inducing walkability is a promising physical strategy for promoting and sustaining Thai urban pedestrian culture.",

        "dc:description": "The noon break or lunch hour in Bangkok's central business district (CBD) is when pedestrians wander around for various activities and purposes, in addition to having a meal, within a limited time frame. It is the only break from their daily working routines for energy recovery or socializing, which, in turn, increases readiness to continue working in the afternoon. Commercial activities preferred by pedestrians during this break contribute to increased economic activity. Since pedestrian behavior depends on the cultural context, this research aims to understand Thai urban pedestrian culture that benefits the public, both socially and economically, and to investigate pedestrians' experience of the physical quality of their walking infrastructure, reflecting their preferences. According to the information gained from observation, a field survey of four hundred thirty observations, and descriptive statistics, the urban pedestrian culture in the CBD of Bangkok is a combination of various activities related to a way of life; 69.4% and 44.9% of observed pedestrians have secondary and tertiary purposes. These multi-purpose trips during lunch hours include having meals, shopping, recovery from work, socializing, and taking care of business or running errands. The routine of lunch outings declined only slightly after the start of the pandemic in early 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic level (81.8% compared to 94.9%). Socializing has strong presence in the culture; 90.5% of group outings occur at least once or twice a week. On the physical side, the walking infrastructure, mainly comprising sidewalks, is used for circulation and as a place for social and economic settings. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, pedestrians' concerns about the physical environment were divided into five groups, as follows: Cluster 1, people concerned about thermal comfort, surface conditions, and sidewalk obstructions. Cluster 2, people concerned about thermal comfort and walking distance. Cluster 3, people concerned about level changes and walking distance. Cluster 4, people concerned about surface conditions and sidewalk obstructions. Lastly, cluster 5, people concerned about sidewalk obstructions, traffic safety, and level changes. In conclusion. significant problems experienced or causing concern to pedestrians include sidewalk obstructions of flow due to insufficient width of the walking space as well as blockages caused by utility infrastructure, or social or economic activities, walking distance, surface conditions of sidewalks, level changes, thermal comfort, and traffic safety, respectively. These experiences and concerns reflect pedestrians' preference for better quality of walking infrastructure. Therefore, inducing walkability is a promising physical strategy for promoting and sustaining Thai urban pedestrian culture.",
