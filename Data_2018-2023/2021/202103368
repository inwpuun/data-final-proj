                "abstracts": "© 2021 Yodmai et al.Background: The evidence of promoting family members\u2019 health care for older adults by applying family networks and theory of planned behavior will lead to mental health and lower the quality of life among older adults in rural community in Thailand is unclear. Objective: The study aimed to assess the effects of health promotion among older adults using an aging family network program to reduce depression and improve quality of life (QOL) among older adults. Patients and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was enrolled on one hundred and ten older adults and their family members. Fifty-five older adult participants joined the health promoting program using family member involvement. This program trained them to change health behaviors such as eating healthy food, exercising, emotion management and disability preventive activities to reduce dementia, stroke and falls. The program was conducted in a rural community for 12 months. A comparison group program conducted usual health promoting activities by health personnel. They evaluated quality of life (QOL) using WHOQOL-OLD measurement, and 30-item geriatric depression scale before implementing interventions and after interventions at 9th and 12th months. Data were analyzed using general linear mixed model analysis. Results: After the intervention, social support and perception of health care from family members were significantly improved at the 9th month. At the 12th month, overall QOL, sensory ability, social participation, intimacy, social support, and perception of health care from family members significantly improved. Depression was also reduced at the 12th month. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that health promotion using family members improved QOL and reduced depression long term. Policymakers should implement programs to improve QOL among older adults. They need to improve the involvement of family members when conducting health promotion among older adults and support funding due to conduct on weekends or in the evening.",

Objective: The study aimed to assess the effects of health promotion among older adults using an aging family network program to reduce depression and improve quality of life (QOL) among older adults. Patients and Methods: This quasi-experimental study was enrolled on one hundred and ten older adults and their family members. Fifty-five older adult participants joined the health promoting program using family member involvement. This program trained them to change health behaviors such as eating healthy food, exercising, emotion management and disability preventive activities to reduce dementia, stroke and falls. The program was conducted in a rural community for 12 months. A comparison group program conducted usual health promoting activities by health personnel. They evaluated quality of life (QOL) using WHOQOL-OLD measurement, and 30-item geriatric depression scale before implementing interventions and after interventions at 9th and 12th months. Data were analyzed using general linear mixed model analysis. Results: After the intervention, social support and perception of health care from family members were significantly improved at the 9th month. At the 12th month, overall QOL, sensory ability, social participation, intimacy, social support, and perception of health care from family members significantly improved. Depression was also reduced at the 12th month. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that health promotion using family members improved QOL and reduced depression long term. Policymakers should implement programs to improve QOL among older adults. They need to improve the involvement of family members when conducting health promotion among older adults and support funding due to conduct on weekends or in the evening.",
