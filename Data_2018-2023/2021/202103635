All rights reserved.This study examines factors influencing the corporate identity (CI) of pharmacy retail stores (PRSs) in Thailand as a means to construct a unique corporate identity to represent their strengths and image abroad. An exploratory sequential design was applied. A pilot study involving interviews with four pharmacists was conducted to obtain the variables, and then a questionnaire was designed and administered to 392 respondents. The collected data was analyzed to examine correlations via descriptive analysis, Pearson\u2019s correlation, and multiple linear regression (MLR). The results show that wisdom and pharmaceutical care explain 44% of the variance in defining Thai PRSs identity. There is a 61% chance that Thai PRSs should consider wisdom as the most important factor. These findings provide useful insights for pharmacists, pharmaceutical entrepreneurs, and owners of PRSs to enhance competitiveness by devising strategies to create their corporate identity. For the qualitative analysis, Thai PRSs should encourage pharmacists to gain real working experience to develop their wisdom, experience, and skills. Besides, PRSs that build identities as knowledgeable, sincere, and compassionate health providers can successfully expand their operations to other ASEAN countries, as end-consumers will be confident in the reliability of their services.",

An exploratory sequential design was applied. A pilot study involving interviews with four pharmacists was conducted to obtain the variables, and then a questionnaire was designed and administered to 392 respondents. The collected data was analyzed to examine correlations via descriptive analysis, Pearson\u2019s correlation, and multiple linear regression (MLR). The results show that wisdom and pharmaceutical care explain 44% of the variance in defining Thai PRSs identity. There is a 61% chance that Thai PRSs should consider wisdom as the most important factor. These findings provide useful insights for pharmacists, pharmaceutical entrepreneurs, and owners of PRSs to enhance competitiveness by devising strategies to create their corporate identity. For the qualitative analysis, Thai PRSs should encourage pharmacists to gain real working experience to develop their wisdom, experience, and skills. Besides, PRSs that build identities as knowledgeable, sincere, and compassionate health providers can successfully expand their operations to other ASEAN countries, as end-consumers will be confident in the reliability of their services.",
