All rights reserved.The genus Hemiplecta is a group of large-sized land snails which have long been used as a food resource by Indochinese people. There are five dextral and four sinistral species currently recognized from Thailand. The dextral group is comprised of two previously recorded species (H. humphreysiana and H. distincta), two newly recorded species (H. funerea and H. esculenta), and one new species (H. nemorosa sp. nov.) from northern Thailand is being proposed. We reassessed the diagnostic characters of the genitalia, mantle edge, and radula. Specimens were classified into the genus Hemiplecta on the basis of the penial verge and shell lobe, and on the characters of a bulbous gametolytic sac without a gametolytic duct. A complete species list, together with photographs of the name-bearing types or authenticated specimens and the taxonomic status of Hemiplecta s.l. that are known from Indochina including Peninsular Malaysia and Myanmar, is provided for the first time. In total, this species list contains 39 available nominal species names described from this area. Type or authentic specimens can be located for 37 nominal species names, of which 25 are illustrated herein and the other 12 were recently illustrated. However, two available species-level names could not be traced to any type specimens. In addition, lectotypes of H. funerea and H. pluto are desig-nated herein to stabilize the names.",

        "dc:description": "The genus Hemiplecta is a group of large-sized land snails which have long been used as a food resource by Indochinese people. There are five dextral and four sinistral species currently recognized from Thailand. The dextral group is comprised of two previously recorded species (H. humphreysiana and H. distincta), two newly recorded species (H. funerea and H. esculenta), and one new species (H. nemorosa sp. nov.) from northern Thailand is being proposed. We reassessed the diagnostic characters of the genitalia, mantle edge, and radula. Specimens were classified into the genus Hemiplecta on the basis of the penial verge and shell lobe, and on the characters of a bulbous gametolytic sac without a gametolytic duct. A complete species list, together with photographs of the name-bearing types or authenticated specimens and the taxonomic status of Hemiplecta s.l. that are known from Indochina including Peninsular Malaysia and Myanmar, is provided for the first time. In total, this species list contains 39 available nominal species names described from this area. Type or authentic specimens can be located for 37 nominal species names, of which 25 are illustrated herein and the other 12 were recently illustrated. However, two available species-level names could not be traced to any type specimens. In addition, lectotypes of H. funerea and H. pluto are desig-nated herein to stabilize the names.",
