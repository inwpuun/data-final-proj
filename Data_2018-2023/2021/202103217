All Rights Reserved.Background: Covid-19 is a recent pandemic problem affecting peoples with all ages but elder population is on high risk. This virus can be transmitted from person to person through saliva droplets. This study has explored factors associated with wearing the surgical mask among Thai elderly. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on 400 elderly people aged 60 years and over. Data were collected through interviews on pretested, validated questionnaires. Factors related to wearing the surgical mask were analyzed by using chi-square and binary logistic regression. This study was ethically approved and written consent was taken prior data collection. Results: Nearly two-thirds 62% of the elderly were female with mean age 68.32 ± 6.934 SD. Mostly 85% of them were wearing a mask when go outside of their home. Factors like; residence (p>.001), education level (p=0.015), occupation (p=0.014) and perceived risk of Covid-19 infection (p>0.001), were associated with the wearing of surgical mask. Conclusion: Study concludes that the elderly using masks during Covid-19 in Thailand were more influenced by residence, education level, occupation and perceived risk of infection. However, use of mask among this population could be increased through addressing these factors at population level.",

This virus can be transmitted from person to person through saliva droplets. This study has explored factors associated with wearing the surgical mask among Thai elderly. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted on 400 elderly people aged 60 years and over. Data were collected through interviews on pretested, validated questionnaires. Factors related to wearing the surgical mask were analyzed by using chi-square and binary logistic regression. This study was ethically approved and written consent was taken prior data collection. Results: Nearly two-thirds 62% of the elderly were female with mean age 68.32 ± 6.934 SD. Mostly 85% of them were wearing a mask when go outside of their home. Factors like; residence (p>.001), education level (p=0.015), occupation (p=0.014) and perceived risk of Covid-19 infection (p>0.001), were associated with the wearing of surgical mask. Conclusion: Study concludes that the elderly using masks during Covid-19 in Thailand were more influenced by residence, education level, occupation and perceived risk of infection. However, use of mask among this population could be increased through addressing these factors at population level.",
