All rights reserved.In the year 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, affected many lives and businesses worldwide. COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan City, China, at the end of December 2019, spread over the entire world in approximately four months. By October 2020, approximately 20 million people were infected and mil-lions had died from this disease. Many health or-ganizations such as the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made COVID-19 their primary focus. Many industries, es-pecially, the tourism industry, were affected by the pandemic as many flight and hotel reservations were canceled. Thailand, a country considered one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, suffered much losses because of this pandemic. Many events and travel bookings were canceled and/or postponed. Many people expressed their views and emotions related to this situation over social media, which is considered a powerful media for spreading news and in-formation. In this research, the views of people who were planning to travel to Bangkok, the capital city and most popular destination in Thailand, were retrieved from Twitter for the dates between April 3 and 30, 2020, the period during which the country underwent nationwide lockdown. Sentiment analysis was performed using the support vector machine al-gorithm. The results showed 71.03% classification ac-curacy based on three sentiment classifications: posi-tive, negative, and neutral. This study could thus provide an insight into travelers\u2019 opinions and sentiments related to the tourism business. Based on the significant terms in each sentiment extracted, strengths and weaknesses of each tourism issue could be obtained, which could be used for making recommendations to the related tourism organizations.",

COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan City, China, at the end of December 2019, spread over the entire world in approximately four months. By October 2020, approximately 20 million people were infected and mil-lions had died from this disease. Many health or-ganizations such as the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made COVID-19 their primary focus. Many industries, es-pecially, the tourism industry, were affected by the pandemic as many flight and hotel reservations were canceled. Thailand, a country considered one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, suffered much losses because of this pandemic. Many events and travel bookings were canceled and/or postponed. Many people expressed their views and emotions related to this situation over social media, which is considered a powerful media for spreading news and in-formation. In this research, the views of people who were planning to travel to Bangkok, the capital city and most popular destination in Thailand, were retrieved from Twitter for the dates between April 3 and 30, 2020, the period during which the country underwent nationwide lockdown. Sentiment analysis was performed using the support vector machine al-gorithm. The results showed 71.03% classification ac-curacy based on three sentiment classifications: posi-tive, negative, and neutral. This study could thus provide an insight into travelers\u2019 opinions and sentiments related to the tourism business. Based on the significant terms in each sentiment extracted, strengths and weaknesses of each tourism issue could be obtained, which could be used for making recommendations to the related tourism organizations.",
