All rights reserved.The objective of this study is to improve the performance of the Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG) process by using the caprylic acid as a single precipitated agent and the replacement plan for the filter press machine to support higher demand in ERIG. The experiments based on the face-center central composite design are performed to investigate the relationship of yield recovery with 1. the concentration of caprylic acid used in the purification process, 2. the flow rate, and 3. the pore size of the filter press machine used in the filtration process. The regression analysis shows no relationship on linear, quadratic, or interactions between yield recovery and the three factors. Fortunately, according to the Analysis of Variance (for comparing means), there is a significant effect of interaction between the flow rate and pore size and the main effect of concentration of caprylic acid on the yield recovery at a 90% confidence level. From the interaction plot, at a flow rate of 10.5 ml/s with a filter media pore size of 6-15 micron, the process has the maximum yield recovery of 15.5% that is significantly superior to those of the other two sizes of filter media at the same flow rate. With a flow rate of 16.8 ml/s, the yield recovery is not significantly different for any pore size. At a flow rate of 4.2 ml/s, the yield recovery is higher when using the pore size of 4-9 and 6-15 micron than those from 5-12 micron. Nevertheless, with a 90% confidence interval for average yield recovery by Tukey comparison, the average yield recovery received from 16.8 ml/s at every pore size and 4.2 ml/s at 4-9 micron are not statistically different. Therefore, with the current size, 5-12 micron, of filter media used in the current process, the flow rate is suggested to be 16.8 ml/s whereas, the caprylic acid concentration of 1% is preferred due to the highest yield recovery compared to other concentration levels and the lowest production cost.",

        "dc:description": "The objective of this study is to improve the performance of the Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG) process by using the caprylic acid as a single precipitated agent and the replacement plan for the filter press machine to support higher demand in ERIG. The experiments based on the face-center central composite design are performed to investigate the relationship of yield recovery with 1. the concentration of caprylic acid used in the purification process, 2. the flow rate, and 3. the pore size of the filter press machine used in the filtration process. The regression analysis shows no relationship on linear, quadratic, or interactions between yield recovery and the three factors. Fortunately, according to the Analysis of Variance (for comparing means), there is a significant effect of interaction between the flow rate and pore size and the main effect of concentration of caprylic acid on the yield recovery at a 90% confidence level. From the interaction plot, at a flow rate of 10.5 ml/s with a filter media pore size of 6-15 micron, the process has the maximum yield recovery of 15.5% that is significantly superior to those of the other two sizes of filter media at the same flow rate. With a flow rate of 16.8 ml/s, the yield recovery is not significantly different for any pore size. At a flow rate of 4.2 ml/s, the yield recovery is higher when using the pore size of 4-9 and 6-15 micron than those from 5-12 micron. Nevertheless, with a 90% confidence interval for average yield recovery by Tukey comparison, the average yield recovery received from 16.8 ml/s at every pore size and 4.2 ml/s at 4-9 micron are not statistically different. Therefore, with the current size, 5-12 micron, of filter media used in the current process, the flow rate is suggested to be 16.8 ml/s whereas, the caprylic acid concentration of 1% is preferred due to the highest yield recovery compared to other concentration levels and the lowest production cost.",
