This study used research and development approach. The virtual classroom system was built up based on theories, principles, and research in education along with the survey results from 720 learners selected using probability sampling method. Then it was tested with 23 undergraduate learners in social sciences and humanities discipline, 21 undergraduate learners in physical science discipline, and 29 undergraduate learners in science and technology discipline. The research instruments were a survey questionnaire on current state and expected state of the system, a system manual and lesson plans, a product assessment form, an observation form of learning the 21st century skills, a learning process assessment form, an opinion questionnaire, and a self-assessment questionnaire. For quantitative analysis, the collected data was analyzed using factor analysis, mean, standard deviation, and t-test. For quality analysis, the system was evaluated and approved by field experts. The results of t-test between pretest and posttest on learning and innovation skills of the samples showed statistically significant difference at the.01 level and their satisfaction with the system was rated at the highest level. The learning process consisted of 4 steps, (1) introduction, (2) learning, (3) creating and innovating, and (4) evaluating. The system contained four subsystems: D1: development of learning and innovation skills, D2: learning ability and experience exchange through technological instructional media, D3: ability in accessing learning resources by using various media in the virtual smart classroom, and D4: test and task assessment submitted via the virtual smart classroom system. The virtual smart classroom had three components which were 1) virtual learning system, 2) mobile learning system, and 3) plug-ins tools.",

        "dc:description": "The objective of this research was to study a virtual smart classroom system for enhancing the 21st century skills in learning and innovation of higher education learners. This study used research and development approach. The virtual classroom system was built up based on theories, principles, and research in education along with the survey results from 720 learners selected using probability sampling method. Then it was tested with 23 undergraduate learners in social sciences and humanities discipline, 21 undergraduate learners in physical science discipline, and 29 undergraduate learners in science and technology discipline. The research instruments were a survey questionnaire on current state and expected state of the system, a system manual and lesson plans, a product assessment form, an observation form of learning the 21st century skills, a learning process assessment form, an opinion questionnaire, and a self-assessment questionnaire. For quantitative analysis, the collected data was analyzed using factor analysis, mean, standard deviation, and t-test. For quality analysis, the system was evaluated and approved by field experts. The results of t-test between pretest and posttest on learning and innovation skills of the samples showed statistically significant difference at the.01 level and their satisfaction with the system was rated at the highest level. The learning process consisted of 4 steps, (1) introduction, (2) learning, (3) creating and innovating, and (4) evaluating. The system contained four subsystems: D1: development of learning and innovation skills, D2: learning ability and experience exchange through technological instructional media, D3: ability in accessing learning resources by using various media in the virtual smart classroom, and D4: test and task assessment submitted via the virtual smart classroom system. The virtual smart classroom had three components which were 1) virtual learning system, 2) mobile learning system, and 3) plug-ins tools.",
