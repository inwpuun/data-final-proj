The open learning focused on giving students access to the content from the university for free, encouragement to share their experiences and comment with students in higher education institutions and prospective learners who were interested in the courses via learning tools to communicate, work and learn together. It is also a guideline to develop an instructional design open learning model to enhance creative problem solving ability of higher education students. It was a quantitative research study which used a questionnaire to collect data. The question items in the instrument were check listed and a rating scale was established which had been approved for validity by 7 experts. The samples consisted of 419 higher education students from 16 universities using correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed as follows; 1. determined: Open learning was positively related to team working and willingness to work with others, group discussion behaviors, usage of teaching and learning media, and creative problem solving abilities. The highest results included the correlation of group discussion and creative problem solving abilities at 609***. 2. included: Applied statistics methods including coefficient correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze open learning, group behavior, usage of teaching and learning media, creative problem solving abilities and resulted with the forecast equation showing creative problem solving abilities = .524, open learning = +.111, team working = + .317, duty to work with others = + .099, group discussion behavior = ** + .371, usage level of teaching and learning media = +.087.",

The open learning focused on giving students access to the content from the university for free, encouragement to share their experiences and comment with students in higher education institutions and prospective learners who were interested in the courses via learning tools to communicate, work and learn together. It is also a guideline to develop an instructional design open learning model to enhance creative problem solving ability of higher education students. It was a quantitative research study which used a questionnaire to collect data. The question items in the instrument were check listed and a rating scale was established which had been approved for validity by 7 experts. The samples consisted of 419 higher education students from 16 universities using correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed as follows; 1. determined: Open learning was positively related to team working and willingness to work with others, group discussion behaviors, usage of teaching and learning media, and creative problem solving abilities. The highest results included the correlation of group discussion and creative problem solving abilities at 609***. 2. included: Applied statistics methods including coefficient correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze open learning, group behavior, usage of teaching and learning media, creative problem solving abilities and resulted with the forecast equation showing creative problem solving abilities = .524, open learning = +.111, team working = + .317, duty to work with others = + .099, group discussion behavior = ** + .371, usage level of teaching and learning media = +.087.",
