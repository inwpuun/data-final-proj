                "abstracts": "© 2018 Elsevier LtdA simultaneous evaluation of various quality attributes of packaged bratwurst using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was developed. Changes in physicochemical (L* a* b* color values, pH and thiobarbituric acid (TBA)), microbiological (total viable counts (TVC) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB)) and sensory (color, odor and overall acceptability) characteristics of the packaged sausages were monitored during storage at 4 ± 1 °C. Reflectance spectra covering a wavelength range of 400\u20131000 nm of the samples were acquired using HSI. The relationships between the quality attributes and the spectroscopic reflectance were investigated using canonical correlation analysis. Among all quality attributes, L* color value, TBA, TVC, LAB, odor and overall acceptability appeared to be highly associated with the reflectance. To facilitate the HSI for rapid image acquisition and data processing, partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was employed for selection of optimal wavelengths. The selected wavelengths were then assembled into multispectral data and used as input variables to optimize the PLSR and artificial neural network models for the prediction of quality attributes of the sausage samples. The HSI technique can be used for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of the product's quality and shelf life.",

        "dc:description": "A simultaneous evaluation of various quality attributes of packaged bratwurst using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was developed. Changes in physicochemical (L* a* b* color values, pH and thiobarbituric acid (TBA)), microbiological (total viable counts (TVC) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB)) and sensory (color, odor and overall acceptability) characteristics of the packaged sausages were monitored during storage at 4 ± 1 °C. Reflectance spectra covering a wavelength range of 400\u20131000 nm of the samples were acquired using HSI. The relationships between the quality attributes and the spectroscopic reflectance were investigated using canonical correlation analysis. Among all quality attributes, L* color value, TBA, TVC, LAB, odor and overall acceptability appeared to be highly associated with the reflectance. To facilitate the HSI for rapid image acquisition and data processing, partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis was employed for selection of optimal wavelengths. The selected wavelengths were then assembled into multispectral data and used as input variables to optimize the PLSR and artificial neural network models for the prediction of quality attributes of the sausage samples. The HSI technique can be used for rapid and nondestructive evaluation of the product's quality and shelf life.",
