The total content of Tin (Sn), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) by aqua regia digestion. The ranges of metal concentration (mg kg-1) were 9.04 - 32.17 mg kg-1 and 6.33 - 36.52 mg kg-1 of Pb in Core A and B; and 32.83 - 68.49 mg kg-1 and 21.63 - 73.59 mg kg-1 of Zn in Core A and B, which is below the Sediment Quality Guidelines of Threshold Effects Concentration (TEC) (35.8 mg Pb kg-1 and 121 mg Zn kg-1). Sn was not detected (< 0.03 mg kg-1). Analysis of the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) clearly indicated that most of the analysed sediment samples were not contaminated with the studied metals since low Igeo values were observed (Igeo Pb and Igeo Zn < 0). The detected enrichment factor (EFPb) values between 2.0 and 6.0 indicated moderate enrichment, while most of the sediments had EFZn values below 2 which exhibited deficiency to minimal enrichment. The EF values in this study (EF > 1.5) indicates a significant portion of the trace metals was delivered from non-crustal materials and that may be delivered by other sources. Correlation analysis showed positive relationships between Pb and Zn in both cores (r = 0.5** Core A and 0.941** Core B). The association of Pb and Zn is possibly because they originated from the same sources. The determination of other metals should be considered further.",

        "dc:description": "This study was conducted to assess the level of metal pollution in sediment samples at two different locations at Saphan Hin, which received water from Bang-Yai canal. The total content of Tin (Sn), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) by aqua regia digestion. The ranges of metal concentration (mg kg-1) were 9.04 - 32.17 mg kg-1 and 6.33 - 36.52 mg kg-1 of Pb in Core A and B; and 32.83 - 68.49 mg kg-1 and 21.63 - 73.59 mg kg-1 of Zn in Core A and B, which is below the Sediment Quality Guidelines of Threshold Effects Concentration (TEC) (35.8 mg Pb kg-1 and 121 mg Zn kg-1). Sn was not detected (< 0.03 mg kg-1). Analysis of the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) clearly indicated that most of the analysed sediment samples were not contaminated with the studied metals since low Igeo values were observed (Igeo Pb and Igeo Zn < 0). The detected enrichment factor (EFPb) values between 2.0 and 6.0 indicated moderate enrichment, while most of the sediments had EFZn values below 2 which exhibited deficiency to minimal enrichment. The EF values in this study (EF > 1.5) indicates a significant portion of the trace metals was delivered from non-crustal materials and that may be delivered by other sources. Correlation analysis showed positive relationships between Pb and Zn in both cores (r = 0.5** Core A and 0.941** Core B). The association of Pb and Zn is possibly because they originated from the same sources. The determination of other metals should be considered further.",
