                "abstracts": "© 2018 IEEE.This research aims to develop a framework for writing a business plan that support innovation for undergraduate students. The scope of this research is circumscribed to undergraduate students in Thailand. In respect of internet technology advancement and the popularity of internet access of teenagers, the researcher employs e-learning instruction media, which is considered a keystone to reduce educational inequalities. The study particularly introduces an established Nanoka's knowledge creation concept, which consists of Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation. In earlier times, this concept has been verified to create the domain of innovation in business organisation. Remarkably, it has been employed in the process of teaching innovative business plans and creativity management. This process specifically incorporates active learning, which turns the passive role of merely listening to active learners. The framework offers three principal contributions: first, to develop a new educational platform that implements active learning into E-Learning styles; second, to develop of an uncommon conceptual framework that adheres to theory reflecting good practices for innovation creation; third, taking this concept into practice, to help the universities build upon core strengths and students' innovation skills. It is the confluence of all contributions that make for a full-fledged entrepreneurial university.",

The scope of this research is circumscribed to undergraduate students in Thailand. In respect of internet technology advancement and the popularity of internet access of teenagers, the researcher employs e-learning instruction media, which is considered a keystone to reduce educational inequalities. The study particularly introduces an established Nanoka's knowledge creation concept, which consists of Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination and Internalisation. In earlier times, this concept has been verified to create the domain of innovation in business organisation. Remarkably, it has been employed in the process of teaching innovative business plans and creativity management. This process specifically incorporates active learning, which turns the passive role of merely listening to active learners. The framework offers three principal contributions: first, to develop a new educational platform that implements active learning into E-Learning styles; second, to develop of an uncommon conceptual framework that adheres to theory reflecting good practices for innovation creation; third, taking this concept into practice, to help the universities build upon core strengths and students' innovation skills. It is the confluence of all contributions that make for a full-fledged entrepreneurial university.",
