                "abstracts": "© 2018 Elsevier B.V.In this study, Pro II and general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software were applied to synthesize and optimize the Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) process. This research had been divided into three main parts. The first part was focused on conceptual process simulation of BHD process. The operating condition analysis method represented operating parameters at 325oC, 500 psig with NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The final commercial products were n-hexadecane and n-octadecane. The input information such as reaction conditions, conversion of each reaction, production yield and products purity were provided by petrochemical industry in Thailand. The second part was concentrated on process improvement in energy efficiency by mathematical programming which was used for designing heat exchanger network (HEN) or heat integration of the process. It decreased operating cost and saved hot and cold utility usages. In final part, techno economic analysis was a key factor that played an important role on investment decision by using economic parameters of net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP). The BHD plant capacity was 10,000 Liters/day which used palm oil as feedstock. The energy consumption was optimized by HEN designed by GAMS programing. The simulation result showed the production rate was 12,374.09 Liters/day, the conversion of biodiesel range was 99.83%, and product yield and purity of commercial product were 79.89 and 99.92% respectively. BHD process required 7 heat exchangers resulting in the reduction of energy consumption on heater from 1,335,233 kJ/h to 655,905 kJ/h or heating utility was saved about 50%. Moreover, BHD process made profit over 45.67 million Baht with PBP of 9.4 years and IRR at 25.40%.",

        "dc:description": "In this study, Pro II and general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software were applied to synthesize and optimize the Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) process. This research had been divided into three main parts. The first part was focused on conceptual process simulation of BHD process. The operating condition analysis method represented operating parameters at 325oC, 500 psig with NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The final commercial products were n-hexadecane and n-octadecane. The input information such as reaction conditions, conversion of each reaction, production yield and products purity were provided by petrochemical industry in Thailand. The second part was concentrated on process improvement in energy efficiency by mathematical programming which was used for designing heat exchanger network (HEN) or heat integration of the process. It decreased operating cost and saved hot and cold utility usages. In final part, techno economic analysis was a key factor that played an important role on investment decision by using economic parameters of net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PBP). The BHD plant capacity was 10,000 Liters/day which used palm oil as feedstock. The energy consumption was optimized by HEN designed by GAMS programing. The simulation result showed the production rate was 12,374.09 Liters/day, the conversion of biodiesel range was 99.83%, and product yield and purity of commercial product were 79.89 and 99.92% respectively. BHD process required 7 heat exchangers resulting in the reduction of energy consumption on heater from 1,335,233 kJ/h to 655,905 kJ/h or heating utility was saved about 50%. Moreover, BHD process made profit over 45.67 million Baht with PBP of 9.4 years and IRR at 25.40%.",
