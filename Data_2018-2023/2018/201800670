The research focuses on developing self-learning habits by using journals for academic observation and applying theory to practice. Data were collected in mixed-methods from 12 third-year undergraduate art education students in Thailand. Results found that students were effective in observation, comparison and analysis of philosophies of different schools \u2013 from art activities, to the physical layout and scheduling of those places visited. The sketchbook aided reflective thinking and utilized many art techniques, highlighting the relationships between content, application of theories, diagramming and mind mapping. Approximately 75 per cent of the experimental group described the content and applied theories in text format and sketches. In addition, students reflected that jotting down content with personal words enhanced their ability for remembering, understanding and applying knowledge. However, some students believed that the RSJ is an important and useful tool that they intended to use again in other disciplines.",

The research focuses on developing self-learning habits by using journals for academic observation and applying theory to practice. Data were collected in mixed-methods from 12 third-year undergraduate art education students in Thailand. Results found that students were effective in observation, comparison and analysis of philosophies of different schools \u2013 from art activities, to the physical layout and scheduling of those places visited. The sketchbook aided reflective thinking and utilized many art techniques, highlighting the relationships between content, application of theories, diagramming and mind mapping. Approximately 75 per cent of the experimental group described the content and applied theories in text format and sketches. In addition, students reflected that jotting down content with personal words enhanced their ability for remembering, understanding and applying knowledge. However, some students believed that the RSJ is an important and useful tool that they intended to use again in other disciplines.",
