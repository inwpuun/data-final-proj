However, governments agree that a resolution must be found to effectively cope with increasing health care costs. Furthermore, national health insurance schemes must be properly refined to suit local situations. Workable health policies and strategies for caring and treating sick people through reduced or cost effective methods must be developed as part of a Universal Health Coverage scheme. A review of progress made toward achieving the WHO goal of health for all. The purpose of this paper is to explore the government\u2019s role and responsibilities to educate and support society to achieve optimum health. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This is a commentary piece. Findings \u2013 Participation and involvement of all people of all walks of life in the development and management of their nation\u2019s health care programs is an important requisite of good health for all. This should include financial participation and co-payment into the national health insurance scheme. Furthermore, national health care systems should involve or include the traditional/local and alternative systems of medicine in the most appropriate manner. Health care has to encompass the total range of comprehensive health interventions, inclusive of at least preventive, curative and rehabilitative care. Originality/value \u2013 This paper provides a review of the current health system constraints and assesses the effectiveness of available options by way of ensuring that a country-specific UHC system may be successfully implemented.",

However, governments agree that a resolution must be found to effectively cope with increasing health care costs. Furthermore, national health insurance schemes must be properly refined to suit local situations. Workable health policies and strategies for caring and treating sick people through reduced or cost effective methods must be developed as part of a Universal Health Coverage scheme. A review of progress made toward achieving the WHO goal of health for all. The purpose of this paper is to explore the government\u2019s role and responsibilities to educate and support society to achieve optimum health. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This is a commentary piece. Findings \u2013 Participation and involvement of all people of all walks of life in the development and management of their nation\u2019s health care programs is an important requisite of good health for all. This should include financial participation and co-payment into the national health insurance scheme. Furthermore, national health care systems should involve or include the traditional/local and alternative systems of medicine in the most appropriate manner. Health care has to encompass the total range of comprehensive health interventions, inclusive of at least preventive, curative and rehabilitative care. Originality/value \u2013 This paper provides a review of the current health system constraints and assesses the effectiveness of available options by way of ensuring that a country-specific UHC system may be successfully implemented.",
