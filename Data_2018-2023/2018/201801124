                "abstracts": "© 2018, IPNA.Background: Evidence has indicated that immediate family members of nephrolithiasis patients had high opportunity to develop stones. However, they are usually not regarded to be at risk, since it is unclear if there are any lithogenic abnormalities found in non-stone-forming nephrolithiasis relatives. Our aim was to investigate urinary metabolic abnormalities in the children of nephrolithiasis patients, compared with the general population. Methods: The 24-h urinary metabolic profile was studied for 28 calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis patients (NL) and 46 of their descendants (ND), as well as 40 non-stone-forming volunteers (V) and 34 of their descendants (VD). Results: There was no difference between age, gender, and serum creatinine between NL vs. V (parental groups) and ND vs. VD (descendant groups). High urinary oxalate in nephrolithiasis and urinary calcium in their descendants was detected. In addition, an elevated urinary excretion rate of calcium, phosphate, protein, and albumin, along with low citrate excretion and high urinary supersaturation was observed in both the nephrolithiasis patients and their descendants. Approximate 17.8\u201324.4% of the nephrolithiasis descendants had a urinary supersaturation higher than the nephrolithiasis level, but none was found in VD group. The level of urinary supersaturation index was correlated with urinary protein and albumin excretion in nephrolithiasis family. Conclusion: It was demonstrated that nephrolithiasis offspring carried several urinary metabolic risks predisposing to stone formation which are similar to their parents, and about one in every five nephrolithiasis children had nephrolithiasis level urinary supersaturation.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Evidence has indicated that immediate family members of nephrolithiasis patients had high opportunity to develop stones. However, they are usually not regarded to be at risk, since it is unclear if there are any lithogenic abnormalities found in non-stone-forming nephrolithiasis relatives. Our aim was to investigate urinary metabolic abnormalities in the children of nephrolithiasis patients, compared with the general population. Methods: The 24-h urinary metabolic profile was studied for 28 calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis patients (NL) and 46 of their descendants (ND), as well as 40 non-stone-forming volunteers (V) and 34 of their descendants (VD). Results: There was no difference between age, gender, and serum creatinine between NL vs. V (parental groups) and ND vs. VD (descendant groups). High urinary oxalate in nephrolithiasis and urinary calcium in their descendants was detected. In addition, an elevated urinary excretion rate of calcium, phosphate, protein, and albumin, along with low citrate excretion and high urinary supersaturation was observed in both the nephrolithiasis patients and their descendants. Approximate 17.8\u201324.4% of the nephrolithiasis descendants had a urinary supersaturation higher than the nephrolithiasis level, but none was found in VD group. The level of urinary supersaturation index was correlated with urinary protein and albumin excretion in nephrolithiasis family. Conclusion: It was demonstrated that nephrolithiasis offspring carried several urinary metabolic risks predisposing to stone formation which are similar to their parents, and about one in every five nephrolithiasis children had nephrolithiasis level urinary supersaturation.",
