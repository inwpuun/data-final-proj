            "xocs:funding-text": "The introduction of smaller grid size in regional groundwater model with more hydraulic conductivities data from more pumping well data and hydraulic conductivity distribution via Kriging methods improved the regional groundwater model simulation in the study area. This study found that there is a good relationship of transmissivity and specific capacity from both short pumping well data and long pumping test data. Then the hydraulic conductivity can be estimated from (short) pumping data from well data records, due to limited pumping data, and used as initial values for parameter optimization in groundwater modeling. Kriging method can be well applied to interpolate hydraulic conductivity distribution. The hydraulic conductivity in the plain is found to be higher than in the mountainous area which is corresponded with hydrogeological characteristics. The Nash-Sutcliffee coefficient in steady-state mode is 0.98m and in transient state is 0.94m for calibration and 0.93 m for verification. In summary, the root mean square calibration error is 3.42m in steady-state mode and 4.53 m in transient mode. The root mean square error of verification model is 4.61 m. The estimated hydraulic conductivities can reflect the fluctuation of water potential in the study area and gave the better distribution. Hence, the proposed parameter estimation and its distribution were proved to workable under limited available well pump test data and can improve the peizometric head simulation when applied to the regional groundwater model in the study area.

The farmers traditionally relied on rain and flood water for crops but the amount needed for rice cultivation was not proper in dry years and used groundwater as a supplement especially in the dry year. In this study, regional groundwater model is developed with small grid size (2km x 2km) and improved by adding more well data, estimating transmissivity from well data and applying the geostatistical method to estimate the hydraulic conductivity distribution. The groundwater model in the Upper Central Plain was calibrated (1993-1999) and verified (2000-2005) using peizometric heads observed. The proposed parameter estimation and its distribution were proved to workable under limited available well pump test data and can improve the peizometric head simulation when applied to the regional groundwater model in the study area.",

The farmers traditionally relied on rain and flood water for crops but the amount needed for rice cultivation was not proper in dry years and used groundwater as a supplement especially in the dry year. In this study, regional groundwater model is developed with small grid size (2km x 2km) and improved by adding more well data, estimating transmissivity from well data and applying the geostatistical method to estimate the hydraulic conductivity distribution. The groundwater model in the Upper Central Plain was calibrated (1993-1999) and verified (2000-2005) using peizometric heads observed. The proposed parameter estimation and its distribution were proved to workable under limited available well pump test data and can improve the peizometric head simulation when applied to the regional groundwater model in the study area.",
