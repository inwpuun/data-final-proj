The development of safety applications could reduce number of road accidents. IEEE 802.11p is a promising standard for intervehicular communication, which would enable the connected-vehicle applications. However, in the well-known network simulators such as NS3 and Omnet, there is no propagation model that can simulate the IEEE 802.11p communication at blind corner realistically. Thus, in this paper, we conducted the real-world experiments of IEEE 802.11p in order to construct the model to describe the characteristics of the IEEE 802.11p communication at the blind corners. According to the experimental results, we observe that the minimum distance between the vehicle and the corner can effectively be represented as the key parameter in the model. Moreover, we have a variable parameter for adjusting the impact of the obstruction which could be different at each type of blind corners. The simulation results using our proposed model are compared with those using the existing obstacle model. The results showed that our proposed model is much more closely aligned with the real experimental results.",

        "dc:description": "Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) has been developed to enhance quality of road transportation. The development of safety applications could reduce number of road accidents. IEEE 802.11p is a promising standard for intervehicular communication, which would enable the connected-vehicle applications. However, in the well-known network simulators such as NS3 and Omnet, there is no propagation model that can simulate the IEEE 802.11p communication at blind corner realistically. Thus, in this paper, we conducted the real-world experiments of IEEE 802.11p in order to construct the model to describe the characteristics of the IEEE 802.11p communication at the blind corners. According to the experimental results, we observe that the minimum distance between the vehicle and the corner can effectively be represented as the key parameter in the model. Moreover, we have a variable parameter for adjusting the impact of the obstruction which could be different at each type of blind corners. The simulation results using our proposed model are compared with those using the existing obstacle model. The results showed that our proposed model is much more closely aligned with the real experimental results.",
