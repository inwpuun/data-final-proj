Despite geographical proximity and cultural affinity, trade and investment between ASEAN and India are substantially lower than the potential. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in goods, implemented in 2010, and the services trade and investment agreement in 2015 between ASEAN and India represent an important effort to enhance regional integration. While ASEAN and India are celebrating the third decade of partnership, the relationship of both partners is not a merely recent product. They have indeed a long experience of interactions, an association made of exchanges, and peaceful interactive influences. India shares both land and maritime boundaries with ASEAN. Civilisational and cultural links between India and the Southeast Asia date back thousands of years. Probably no other country has such strong links with the Southeast Asia region as much as India by way of religion, language, culture and civilisation. People in Southeast Asia, by nature, seem to enjoy and treasure the feelings of this closeness. India is perceived by Southeast Asian countries as a benevolent power. Despite deep and structural influence of India on Southeast Asia, the region has nevertheless been able to transform into its own version of Indianisation as it is rooted in the constructive and rich landscape and melting pot of culture and history.",

Despite geographical proximity and cultural affinity, trade and investment between ASEAN and India are substantially lower than the potential. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in goods, implemented in 2010, and the services trade and investment agreement in 2015 between ASEAN and India represent an important effort to enhance regional integration. While ASEAN and India are celebrating the third decade of partnership, the relationship of both partners is not a merely recent product. They have indeed a long experience of interactions, an association made of exchanges, and peaceful interactive influences. India shares both land and maritime boundaries with ASEAN. Civilisational and cultural links between India and the Southeast Asia date back thousands of years. Probably no other country has such strong links with the Southeast Asia region as much as India by way of religion, language, culture and civilisation. People in Southeast Asia, by nature, seem to enjoy and treasure the feelings of this closeness. India is perceived by Southeast Asian countries as a benevolent power. Despite deep and structural influence of India on Southeast Asia, the region has nevertheless been able to transform into its own version of Indianisation as it is rooted in the constructive and rich landscape and melting pot of culture and history.",
