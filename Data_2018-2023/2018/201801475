A full account of the experimental design and data analysis are provided in the research report for the first stage of the study (MacKay, 1995). The study was designed to respond to serious levels of reading failure in primary school children in an area of multiple social disadvantage. It was conducted within the context of a series of research studies on the theme of schools and teachers as consumers of psychological services (Boyle & MacKay, 1990; MacKay & Boyle, 1994). These studies had indicated that while schools continued to view individual casework as their first priority for service delivery, they also valued the potential contribution of the psychologist in projects and research. A context for agreeing with schools an appropriate balance between casework and project work had been established within the same psychological service by means of a system of negotiated school contracts (Vassie & Watson, 1990). The use of such a contract in a large primary school in a socially disadvantaged area led to a request from the school for a research study aimed at addressing a problem of considerable proportions \u2013 a serious level of educational underachievement in a large group of pupils at approximately the mid-point of their primary schooling. Despite a strong emphasis on meeting the needs of pupils with learning difficulties and a variety of imaginative interventions carried out by the school, these pupils had failed to make progress in basic reading skills, and most of them had remained almost static in their group reading test scores for a period of three years. The purpose of the present study was to address that issue.",

One of such pollutant, carbamazepine (CBZ) has been found to be toxic to aquatic invertebrates, fish, bacteria, algae and cause severe side effects in humans. Nano-remediation has received considerable attention in recent years due to their good adsorption capacity because of their large surface area. In the present study, the efficacy of eco-friendly biosynthesized hematite nanoparticles to remove CBZ in water sample as a function of time and concentration was studied. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were about 20\u201340 nm in diameter. The adsorption efficiency increased with time and attained equilibrium within 2.5 h. The experimental results best fitted to Freundlich model, suggesting the multilayer adsorption of CBZ on hematite nanoparticles. Within 2 h, >90% of CBZ desorbed from hematite nanoparticle surface. It was concluded that hematite nanoparticles produced by biosynthesis can be considered as an effective CBZ adsorbent.",

One of such pollutant, carbamazepine (CBZ) has been found to be toxic to aquatic invertebrates, fish, bacteria, algae and cause severe side effects in humans. Nano-remediation has received considerable attention in recent years due to their good adsorption capacity because of their large surface area. In the present study, the efficacy of eco-friendly biosynthesized hematite nanoparticles to remove CBZ in water sample as a function of time and concentration was studied. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the nanoparticles were about 20\u201340 nm in diameter. The adsorption efficiency increased with time and attained equilibrium within 2.5 h. The experimental results best fitted to Freundlich model, suggesting the multilayer adsorption of CBZ on hematite nanoparticles. Within 2 h, >90% of CBZ desorbed from hematite nanoparticle surface. It was concluded that hematite nanoparticles produced by biosynthesis can be considered as an effective CBZ adsorbent.",
