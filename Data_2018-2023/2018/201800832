                "abstracts": "Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.Chulalongkorn University (CU) is located at the heart of Bangkok, which is one of the most traffic congested cities in the world. It is very crucial for the university to develop a green and clean transportation system that is good for both the CU community and the whole society. To reduce on-campus traffic, the university provides four parking buildings on the edge of four corners of the campus to serve visitors, students, faculties and staffs who travel by private cars. While providing added convenience, these parking garages reduce traffic congestion on campus and, thus, pollutions from harmful emissions and traffic noises. To promote eco-friendly transportation in the campus, the university provides \"CU Shuttle Bus\" - an electric shuttle bus service that cover not only campus area, but also reach out to public sky train and subway stations around the campus. The CU Shuttle Bus's mobile application, developed by engineering students, helps improve user experience by showing all useful information including campus map, bus routing, and real-time locations of all buses. To encourage walking and cycling within the campus and to promote good health and fitness, the university has been constructing covered walkways and bike lanes throughout the campus. In addition, \"CU Bike\" - a bike sharing program, was first introduced in 2014 and has quickly grown in popularity among CU students since. A new \"CU Toyota Hamo\", an electric vehicle rental program, is another great option of green transportations for those who cannot ride a bicycle and for older people of the aging society. All these projects help promote the development of innovations and practices that are both sustainable and protective of the environment of Chulalongkorn University, as well as the surrounding community, the country and planet as a whole.",

        "dc:description": "Chulalongkorn University (CU) is located at the heart of Bangkok, which is one of the most traffic congested cities in the world. It is very crucial for the university to develop a green and clean transportation system that is good for both the CU community and the whole society. To reduce on-campus traffic, the university provides four parking buildings on the edge of four corners of the campus to serve visitors, students, faculties and staffs who travel by private cars. While providing added convenience, these parking garages reduce traffic congestion on campus and, thus, pollutions from harmful emissions and traffic noises. To promote eco-friendly transportation in the campus, the university provides \"CU Shuttle Bus\" - an electric shuttle bus service that cover not only campus area, but also reach out to public sky train and subway stations around the campus. The CU Shuttle Bus's mobile application, developed by engineering students, helps improve user experience by showing all useful information including campus map, bus routing, and real-time locations of all buses. To encourage walking and cycling within the campus and to promote good health and fitness, the university has been constructing covered walkways and bike lanes throughout the campus. In addition, \"CU Bike\" - a bike sharing program, was first introduced in 2014 and has quickly grown in popularity among CU students since. A new \"CU Toyota Hamo\", an electric vehicle rental program, is another great option of green transportations for those who cannot ride a bicycle and for older people of the aging society. All these projects help promote the development of innovations and practices that are both sustainable and protective of the environment of Chulalongkorn University, as well as the surrounding community, the country and planet as a whole.",
