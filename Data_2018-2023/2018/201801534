                "abstracts": "© Manila Prak and Suvinee Wivatvanit.Purpose \u2013 Cambodia has one of the highest death rates for children under five years of age in Southeast Asia. The high mortality rate of children under five years of age, especially the neonate is 35 per 1,000 for the period zero to four years. There are no neonatal nursing standards of practice to guide nurses providing neonatal nursing care. Some general guidelines are currently being implemented for both doctors and nurses. The Minister for Health officially launched the Cambodian Council of Nurses\u2019 Guideline for the Standard of Nursing Care in December 2015. In the absence of specific neonatal nursing standards of practice, the purpose of this paper is to develop the Neonatal Nursing Standard of Practice for Cambodia. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The Delphi technique was selected as being appropriate for this study. The snowball with purposive sampling was used. The identified experts were located across Cambodia so the e-Delphi approach was considered appropriate and applicable according to the study context. Four experts preferred to be interviewed face-to-face, while 16 experts were confident to use e-mail to respond to the questionnaire in Round 1. In total, 19 experts provided responses via e-mail to the Rounds 2 and 3 questionnaires. Findings \u2013 A Standard for Neonatal Nursing Practice for Cambodia which consists of ten standards was found as a result of this study: assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, implementation, evaluation, ethics, evidence-based practice and research, health teaching and health promotion, continuing education, and communication. Originality/value \u2013 All items and sub-items achieved consensus as either being at the most significant level and therefore, could be key indicators for neonatal nursing standards of practice. The results of this study can be incorporated into a focused discussion led by the Nursing and Midwifery Bureau of the Ministry of Health to develop national standards of practice for neonatal nurses in Cambodia.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose \u2013 Cambodia has one of the highest death rates for children under five years of age in Southeast Asia. The high mortality rate of children under five years of age, especially the neonate is 35 per 1,000 for the period zero to four years. There are no neonatal nursing standards of practice to guide nurses providing neonatal nursing care. Some general guidelines are currently being implemented for both doctors and nurses. The Minister for Health officially launched the Cambodian Council of Nurses\u2019 Guideline for the Standard of Nursing Care in December 2015. In the absence of specific neonatal nursing standards of practice, the purpose of this paper is to develop the Neonatal Nursing Standard of Practice for Cambodia. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The Delphi technique was selected as being appropriate for this study. The snowball with purposive sampling was used. The identified experts were located across Cambodia so the e-Delphi approach was considered appropriate and applicable according to the study context. Four experts preferred to be interviewed face-to-face, while 16 experts were confident to use e-mail to respond to the questionnaire in Round 1. In total, 19 experts provided responses via e-mail to the Rounds 2 and 3 questionnaires. Findings \u2013 A Standard for Neonatal Nursing Practice for Cambodia which consists of ten standards was found as a result of this study: assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, implementation, evaluation, ethics, evidence-based practice and research, health teaching and health promotion, continuing education, and communication. Originality/value \u2013 All items and sub-items achieved consensus as either being at the most significant level and therefore, could be key indicators for neonatal nursing standards of practice. The results of this study can be incorporated into a focused discussion led by the Nursing and Midwifery Bureau of the Ministry of Health to develop national standards of practice for neonatal nurses in Cambodia.",
