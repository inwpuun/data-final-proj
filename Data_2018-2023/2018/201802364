                "abstracts": "© 2018 Dechsupa et al.Background. Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common cause of low back pain with degenerative spinal change in older adults. Telomeres are repetitive nucleoproteinDNA sequences of TTAGGG at the ends of chromosomes. Oxidative stress originates from an imbalance in pro-oxidant and antioxidant homeostasis that results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The purpose of this study was to investigate relative telomere length (RTL) and oxidative DNA damage in ligamentum flavum (LF) tissue from LSS patients. Methods. Forty-eight patients with LSS participated in this study. Genomic DNA from non-hypertrophic and hypertrophic LF tissue were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for relative telomere length (RTL). 8-hydroxy 2'-deoxygaunosine (8-OHdG) levels were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We cultivated LF fibroblast cells from patients in different ages (61, 66, and 77 years). After each cultivation cycle, we examined RTL and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) expression. Results. The hypertrophic LF had significantly lower RTL than non-hypertrophic LF (P = 0:04). The levels of 8-OHdG were significantly higher in hypertrophic LF compared to non-hypertrophic LF (P=0:02). With advancing cell culture passage, the number of cells in each passage was significantly lower in hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells than non-hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells. When evaluated with SA-β-gal staining, all senescent LF fibroblast cells were observed at earlier passages in hypertrophic LF compared with non-hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells. Discussion. Our results showed that patients with LSS displayed an accelerated RTL shortening and high oxidative stress in hypertrophic LF. These findings implied that telomere shortening and oxidative stress may play roles in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic LF in lumbar spinal stenosis.",

        "dc:description": "Background. Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common cause of low back pain with degenerative spinal change in older adults. Telomeres are repetitive nucleoproteinDNA sequences of TTAGGG at the ends of chromosomes. Oxidative stress originates from an imbalance in pro-oxidant and antioxidant homeostasis that results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The purpose of this study was to investigate relative telomere length (RTL) and oxidative DNA damage in ligamentum flavum (LF) tissue from LSS patients. Methods. Forty-eight patients with LSS participated in this study. Genomic DNA from non-hypertrophic and hypertrophic LF tissue were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for relative telomere length (RTL). 8-hydroxy 2'-deoxygaunosine (8-OHdG) levels were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We cultivated LF fibroblast cells from patients in different ages (61, 66, and 77 years). After each cultivation cycle, we examined RTL and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) expression. Results. The hypertrophic LF had significantly lower RTL than non-hypertrophic LF (P = 0:04). The levels of 8-OHdG were significantly higher in hypertrophic LF compared to non-hypertrophic LF (P=0:02). With advancing cell culture passage, the number of cells in each passage was significantly lower in hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells than non-hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells. When evaluated with SA-β-gal staining, all senescent LF fibroblast cells were observed at earlier passages in hypertrophic LF compared with non-hypertrophic LF fibroblast cells. Discussion. Our results showed that patients with LSS displayed an accelerated RTL shortening and high oxidative stress in hypertrophic LF. These findings implied that telomere shortening and oxidative stress may play roles in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic LF in lumbar spinal stenosis.",
