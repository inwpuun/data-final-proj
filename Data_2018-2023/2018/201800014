One output included a Thai Policy Brief which pointed out some gaps in OA education and research in universities [7]. In mid-2016 we began another study funded by the UNISEARCH office of CU about University-based Agriculture Extension services in Southeast Asia, and how they contributed to OA and agro-ecology. Those findings are preliminary, but already suggestive. The Thai case points to a significant lack of university-based extension services supporting OA [8]. Anotherproject, a desk-study, reviewed policies, curricula and extension services of the nine government-designated national research university (NRU) to examine their attention to sustainable agriculture (SA) education. It found that SA was poorly taught, studied or practiced (with OA even less) in most elite universities. This was despite agriculture\u201fs importance to the Thai economy and society and national policies ostensibly supporting sustainable development generally [5]. In addition, as we argue elsewhere, Thai HEIs do not appear to be actively or strategically contributing to OA mainstreaming or up-scaling in Thailand [4].",

                "abstracts": "© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Since the 1950s Green Revolution \"conventional\" agrochemical-dependent farming has grown substantially in Thailand. Adverse impacts have been natural resources depletion, environmental pollution, deforestation, food contamination and public health concerns. Thai higher education institutions (HEIs) have contributed to problems, promoting agrochemical-dependent farming with limited attention to organic agriculture (OA). Our paper examines how Thai HEIs incorporate OA into curricula and extension services, and how students perceive the value and adequacy of OA courses and training. It reviews policy and syllabus documents among 49 HEIs. Our analysis suggests most universities still do not view OA as a priority. Second, we examine student and graduate perceptions to illustrate national challenges. A survey of senior undergraduate students and recent alumni in one HEI showed both groups believed they did not have sufficient lectures or courses in OA or adequate resources and training to pursue an OA-related career after graduation. Current students viewed inadequacies even greater. Our conclusions suggest Thai HEIs must do more to reform programs, improve OA curricula and better support graduates. More research is needed to gather detailed and refined information from university agriculture education program administrators and documents with more qualitative and quantitative data on students from other Thai Universities.",

        "dc:description": "Since the 1950s Green Revolution \"conventional\" agrochemical-dependent farming has grown substantially in Thailand. Adverse impacts have been natural resources depletion, environmental pollution, deforestation, food contamination and public health concerns. Thai higher education institutions (HEIs) have contributed to problems, promoting agrochemical-dependent farming with limited attention to organic agriculture (OA). Our paper examines how Thai HEIs incorporate OA into curricula and extension services, and how students perceive the value and adequacy of OA courses and training. It reviews policy and syllabus documents among 49 HEIs. Our analysis suggests most universities still do not view OA as a priority. Second, we examine student and graduate perceptions to illustrate national challenges. A survey of senior undergraduate students and recent alumni in one HEI showed both groups believed they did not have sufficient lectures or courses in OA or adequate resources and training to pursue an OA-related career after graduation. Current students viewed inadequacies even greater. Our conclusions suggest Thai HEIs must do more to reform programs, improve OA curricula and better support graduates. More research is needed to gather detailed and refined information from university agriculture education program administrators and documents with more qualitative and quantitative data on students from other Thai Universities.",
