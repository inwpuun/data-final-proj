                {"$": "First, the organizational structure of Yen Lenh Bridge is described in Figure 3. The Yen Lenh Bridge is 2.23 km long. It is located in the northern part of Vietnam and it spans the Red river. It was built as an alternative route to connect the two provinces of Hung Yen and Ha Nam (Ogunlana & Abednego, 2009). Although the project was developed under a BOT form, nearly half of the project cost was funded by the government and the two provinces (USD11 million), while Thang Long Construction Corporation (TLC) and Civil Engineering Construction Corporation No. 4 (CIENCO No. 4) covered the remaining cost. The Ministry of Transportation appointed the East Sea Project Management Unit (ESPMU, 2002) on behalf of the Ministry in the Concession Company, while the Vietnam Road Administration acted as an independent reviewer for the concession company to ensure the quality of the construction design and implementation (Figure 3). The Transportation Engineering Design Corporation was then appointed by the concessionaire and ESPMU to be the consulting company to design and supervise the project. The concession company was also supported by the central government through agreements with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Investment and Planning, while the Vietnam Development and Investment Bank provided investment funding and a financial guarantee towards the concessionaire to help ensure the project\u2019s financial stability, especially during its construction stage, and the Vietnam Insurance Company agreed to provide insurance to guarantee the construction of the project. Additionally, the Yen Lenh BOT Company was established by the concessionaire in 2003 to operate the project for the agreed concession period."},

                "abstracts": "© 2018, Prince of Songkla University. All rights reserved.The increasing demand for transportation and the ineffectiveness in financing infrastructure projects contribute to various challenges for Vietnam in the recent decades. Financial investment in infrastructure projects is usually so large that the state budget cannot cover all of it. In order to encounter this challenge, Vietnam has called for the participation of other economic sectors, especially the private sector. Consequently, the government has been cooperating with the private sector in the form of public-private partnership (PPP). The development of PPP projects faces a variety of critical risks; therefore, it is challenging for the government to attract private investors. This paper investigates the problems affecting the performance of PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. We gathered general information and organizational structures of the PPP projects as well as compiled the problems experienced in previous PPP projects through in-depth interviews with PPP experts in Vietnam. Interestingly, there are a large number of critical problems affecting the feasibility stage of PPP projects, including inadequate feasibility studies, changes in the laws and regulations, government intervention, lack of transparency in bidding, unfair process of selection in the private sector, and conflicting or imperfect contracts. In addition, the only one significant success factor in the PPP projects was incentives provided by the government. The results of this study can assist in implementing PPP transportation projects in Vietnam so that the nation can establish public policies that attract both domestic and foreign private investors.",

Financial investment in infrastructure projects is usually so large that the state budget cannot cover all of it. In order to encounter this challenge, Vietnam has called for the participation of other economic sectors, especially the private sector. Consequently, the government has been cooperating with the private sector in the form of public-private partnership (PPP). The development of PPP projects faces a variety of critical risks; therefore, it is challenging for the government to attract private investors. This paper investigates the problems affecting the performance of PPP transportation projects in Vietnam. We gathered general information and organizational structures of the PPP projects as well as compiled the problems experienced in previous PPP projects through in-depth interviews with PPP experts in Vietnam. Interestingly, there are a large number of critical problems affecting the feasibility stage of PPP projects, including inadequate feasibility studies, changes in the laws and regulations, government intervention, lack of transparency in bidding, unfair process of selection in the private sector, and conflicting or imperfect contracts. In addition, the only one significant success factor in the PPP projects was incentives provided by the government. The results of this study can assist in implementing PPP transportation projects in Vietnam so that the nation can establish public policies that attract both domestic and foreign private investors.",
