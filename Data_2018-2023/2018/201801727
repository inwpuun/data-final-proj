DMAIC methodology of six sigma was applied to solve the problems. The team was established to reduce the defective rate to achieve production performance KPI. Define- the objective and scope were set through the 80:20 of Pareto chart which identified the main focused problem. Measure- the related precision and accuracy of component parts compare with specification, process capability of each component part of manufacturer which were lower than target were selected. Analysis- cause-and-effect diagram was conducted at each component to show possible causes of the problem, specify the factors that effected to process mean or process variation and summarized its root causes. FMEA was performed to confirm current process control of each factor and statistical hypothesis testing was used to prove the main factors that affect process inconsistency of each part. Improve- TRIZ was applied as the quick and accurate idea generating and excellence decision making from various alternative solutions to resolve technical contradiction. Pugh's matrix was adopted to improve the solutions and logically establish criteria to select the best efficient idea. Control- according to the above performed, the overall defectives was reduced from 387 PPM to 198 PPM or approximately 51.2% compared to the average of defectives in seven month ago.",

        "dc:description": "This paper aims for innovative solutions by using TRIZ to reduce four highest defective parts of a new automotive model which yields 85% of the supplier part's defective rates. DMAIC methodology of six sigma was applied to solve the problems. The team was established to reduce the defective rate to achieve production performance KPI. Define- the objective and scope were set through the 80:20 of Pareto chart which identified the main focused problem. Measure- the related precision and accuracy of component parts compare with specification, process capability of each component part of manufacturer which were lower than target were selected. Analysis- cause-and-effect diagram was conducted at each component to show possible causes of the problem, specify the factors that effected to process mean or process variation and summarized its root causes. FMEA was performed to confirm current process control of each factor and statistical hypothesis testing was used to prove the main factors that affect process inconsistency of each part. Improve- TRIZ was applied as the quick and accurate idea generating and excellence decision making from various alternative solutions to resolve technical contradiction. Pugh's matrix was adopted to improve the solutions and logically establish criteria to select the best efficient idea. Control- according to the above performed, the overall defectives was reduced from 387 PPM to 198 PPM or approximately 51.2% compared to the average of defectives in seven month ago.",
