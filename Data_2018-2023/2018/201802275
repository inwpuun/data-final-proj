                "abstracts": "© 2018 Manwong et al.Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effects of a group activity-based motivational enhancement therapy (GA-MET) program on social media addictive behaviors among junior high school students. Materials and methods: This cluster randomized trial was performed in 245 junior high school students who used social media in the lower part of northeast Thailand. The GA-MET program group and the control group sessions lasted 8 weeks and were followed up 4 weeks later. The addictive social media behaviors, average duration of social media usage during weekdays and weekends (hours/day), child behaviors, self-esteem, and depression were investigated using a self-reported questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression was used to compare the mean and 95% CIs between two groups. Results: The GA-MET program significantly decreased the average duration of social media usage during weekdays and weekends (hours/day) (\u20131.27, 95% CI: −2.18,\u20130.37 and \u20131.25, 95% CI: −2.22, \u20130.29, respectively), emotional behavior (\u20130.69, 95% CI: −1.18, \u20130.19), and depression (\u20134.03, 95% CI: −6.07, \u20131.99) in the treated group compared to the control group. Conclusion: The GA-MET program could reduce the risk of social media addictive behaviors in junior high school students in Thailand by decreasing time spent on social media, emotional behaviors, and depression.",

        "dc:description": "Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effects of a group activity-based motivational enhancement therapy (GA-MET) program on social media addictive behaviors among junior high school students. Materials and methods: This cluster randomized trial was performed in 245 junior high school students who used social media in the lower part of northeast Thailand. The GA-MET program group and the control group sessions lasted 8 weeks and were followed up 4 weeks later. The addictive social media behaviors, average duration of social media usage during weekdays and weekends (hours/day), child behaviors, self-esteem, and depression were investigated using a self-reported questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression was used to compare the mean and 95% CIs between two groups. Results: The GA-MET program significantly decreased the average duration of social media usage during weekdays and weekends (hours/day) (\u20131.27, 95% CI: −2.18,\u20130.37 and \u20131.25, 95% CI: −2.22, \u20130.29, respectively), emotional behavior (\u20130.69, 95% CI: −1.18, \u20130.19), and depression (\u20134.03, 95% CI: −6.07, \u20131.99) in the treated group compared to the control group. Conclusion: The GA-MET program could reduce the risk of social media addictive behaviors in junior high school students in Thailand by decreasing time spent on social media, emotional behaviors, and depression.",
