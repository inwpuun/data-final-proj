                "abstracts": "© 2022 by the authors.A dysregulation of the cell-death mechanism contributes to poor prognosis in lung cancer. New potent chemotherapeutic agents targeting apoptosis-deregulating molecules have been discovered. In this study, 22-(4-pyridinecarbonyl) jorunnamycin A (22-(4\u2032py)-JA), a synthetic derivative of bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone from the Thai blue sponge, was semisynthesized by the Steglich esterification method, and its pharmacological mechanism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was elucidated by a network pharmacology approach. All predicted targets of 22-(4\u2032py)-JA and genes related to NSCLC were retrieved from drug-target and gene databases. A total of 78 core targets were identified, and their associations were analyzed by STRING and Cytoscape. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that molecules in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling were potential targets of 22-(4\u2032py)-JA in the induction of NSCLC apoptosis. In silico molecular docking analysis displayed a possible interaction of ERK1/2 and MEK1 with 22-(4\u2032py)-JA. In vitro anticancer activity showed that 22-(4\u2032py)-JA has strong cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects in H460, H292 and A549 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting confirmed that 22-(4\u2032py)-JA induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK/MEK/Bcl-2-dependent manner. The present study demonstrated that 22-(4\u2032py)-JA exhibited a potent anticancer effect that could be further developed for clinical application and showed that network pharmacology approaches are a powerful tool to illustrate the molecular pathways of new drugs or compounds.",

        "dc:description": "A dysregulation of the cell-death mechanism contributes to poor prognosis in lung cancer. New potent chemotherapeutic agents targeting apoptosis-deregulating molecules have been discovered. In this study, 22-(4-pyridinecarbonyl) jorunnamycin A (22-(4\u2032py)-JA), a synthetic derivative of bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone from the Thai blue sponge, was semisynthesized by the Steglich esterification method, and its pharmacological mechanism in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was elucidated by a network pharmacology approach. All predicted targets of 22-(4\u2032py)-JA and genes related to NSCLC were retrieved from drug-target and gene databases. A total of 78 core targets were identified, and their associations were analyzed by STRING and Cytoscape. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that molecules in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling were potential targets of 22-(4\u2032py)-JA in the induction of NSCLC apoptosis. In silico molecular docking analysis displayed a possible interaction of ERK1/2 and MEK1 with 22-(4\u2032py)-JA. In vitro anticancer activity showed that 22-(4\u2032py)-JA has strong cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects in H460, H292 and A549 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting confirmed that 22-(4\u2032py)-JA induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK/MEK/Bcl-2-dependent manner. The present study demonstrated that 22-(4\u2032py)-JA exhibited a potent anticancer effect that could be further developed for clinical application and showed that network pharmacology approaches are a powerful tool to illustrate the molecular pathways of new drugs or compounds.",
