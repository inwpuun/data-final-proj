                "abstracts": "Copyright 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.It has been well documented in the literature that commingled wells in which the different layers have different levels of formation damage - also known as skin - yield anomalous values of formation transmissibility (kh) when they are tested. Specifically, the apparent transmissibility resulting from pressure transient analysis of such wells is typically lower than the arithmetical sum of the transmissibilities of the individual layers. The objective of this study is to present a simple method to quantify this kh reduction effect that is applicable to cases with unlimited numbers of layers that may have different layer pressures as well as different skins. The methodology starts with the quantification of each layer's productivity index (J), as a function of its kh and skin, during transient inflow conditions. During this transient period, J is not constant but decreases with time, and the apparent kh of the well is then calculated as a function of the evolution with time of the productivity indices of the individual layers. The method is applied to cases where layer skins are different but initial layer pressures are the same, as well as to cases where both skins and pressures differ between layers. The method is then extended again to the case of stabilized inflow conditions, at which time J is conventionally considered to be no longer changing. The outcome of the study is a simple equation that allows the apparent transmissibility of the commingled well to be calculated, for any number of layers with differing pressures and skins, under transient or stabilized inflow conditions. The quantification of the apparent transmissibility then allows the apparent total-well skin to be easily calculated. It is shown that, for certain combinations of layer skins and layer pressures, the transmissibility reduction effect is significantly smaller than expected and, in some circumstances, might not be observed at all. This result is at odds with the current understanding as set out elsewhere in the literature. The results of this study point towards alternatives to the conventional methods that are used for testing and analyzing commingled wells, and also have implications for the design of well stimulation programs.",

        "dc:description": "It has been well documented in the literature that commingled wells in which the different layers have different levels of formation damage - also known as skin - yield anomalous values of formation transmissibility (kh) when they are tested. Specifically, the apparent transmissibility resulting from pressure transient analysis of such wells is typically lower than the arithmetical sum of the transmissibilities of the individual layers. The objective of this study is to present a simple method to quantify this kh reduction effect that is applicable to cases with unlimited numbers of layers that may have different layer pressures as well as different skins. The methodology starts with the quantification of each layer's productivity index (J), as a function of its kh and skin, during transient inflow conditions. During this transient period, J is not constant but decreases with time, and the apparent kh of the well is then calculated as a function of the evolution with time of the productivity indices of the individual layers. The method is applied to cases where layer skins are different but initial layer pressures are the same, as well as to cases where both skins and pressures differ between layers. The method is then extended again to the case of stabilized inflow conditions, at which time J is conventionally considered to be no longer changing. The outcome of the study is a simple equation that allows the apparent transmissibility of the commingled well to be calculated, for any number of layers with differing pressures and skins, under transient or stabilized inflow conditions. The quantification of the apparent transmissibility then allows the apparent total-well skin to be easily calculated. It is shown that, for certain combinations of layer skins and layer pressures, the transmissibility reduction effect is significantly smaller than expected and, in some circumstances, might not be observed at all. This result is at odds with the current understanding as set out elsewhere in the literature. The results of this study point towards alternatives to the conventional methods that are used for testing and analyzing commingled wells, and also have implications for the design of well stimulation programs.",
