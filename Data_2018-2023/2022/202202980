                "abstracts": "© 2021 American Heart Association, Inc.The study aimed to investigate whether serum sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1) at 11-13 weeks\u2019 gestation in pregnancies that subsequently developed preeclampsia was different from those without preeclampsia and compare screening performance of the International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications (IPPIC) reported models, which include various combinations of maternal factors, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, PlGF (placental growth factor) and sFlt-1 and the competing risk (CR) models, which include various combinations of maternal factors, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PlGF for predicting any-onset, early-onset, and late-onset preeclampsia. This was a prospective multicenter study in 7877 singleton pregnancies. The differences of the predictive performance between the IPPIC and CR models were compared. There were 141 women (1.79%) who developed preeclampsia, including 13 cases (0.17%) of early-onset preeclampsia and 128 cases (1.62%) of late-onset preeclampsia. In pregnancies that developed preeclampsia compared to unaffected pregnancies, median serum sFlt-1 levels and its MoMs were not significantly different (p>0.05). There was no significant association between gestational age at delivery and log10 sFlt-1 and log10 sFlt-1 MoM (p>0.05). The areas under the curve of CR models were significantly higher than the IPPIC models for the prediction of any-onset and late-onset preeclampsia but not for early-onset preeclampsia. In conclusion, there are no significant differences in the maternal serum sFlt-1 levels at 11-13 weeks\u2019 gestation between women who subsequently develop preeclampsia and those who do not. Moreover, the CR models for the prediction of any-onset and late-onset preeclampsia perform better than the IPPIC reported model.",

        "dc:description": "The study aimed to investigate whether serum sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1) at 11-13 weeks\u2019 gestation in pregnancies that subsequently developed preeclampsia was different from those without preeclampsia and compare screening performance of the International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications (IPPIC) reported models, which include various combinations of maternal factors, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, PlGF (placental growth factor) and sFlt-1 and the competing risk (CR) models, which include various combinations of maternal factors, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PlGF for predicting any-onset, early-onset, and late-onset preeclampsia. This was a prospective multicenter study in 7877 singleton pregnancies. The differences of the predictive performance between the IPPIC and CR models were compared. There were 141 women (1.79%) who developed preeclampsia, including 13 cases (0.17%) of early-onset preeclampsia and 128 cases (1.62%) of late-onset preeclampsia. In pregnancies that developed preeclampsia compared to unaffected pregnancies, median serum sFlt-1 levels and its MoMs were not significantly different (p>0.05). There was no significant association between gestational age at delivery and log10 sFlt-1 and log10 sFlt-1 MoM (p>0.05). The areas under the curve of CR models were significantly higher than the IPPIC models for the prediction of any-onset and late-onset preeclampsia but not for early-onset preeclampsia. In conclusion, there are no significant differences in the maternal serum sFlt-1 levels at 11-13 weeks\u2019 gestation between women who subsequently develop preeclampsia and those who do not. Moreover, the CR models for the prediction of any-onset and late-onset preeclampsia perform better than the IPPIC reported model.",
