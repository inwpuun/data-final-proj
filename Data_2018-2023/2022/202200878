                "abstracts": "© 2022 by the authors.The present study focused on the development and application of two computer numerical models, namely, a seepage model developed using SEEP/W software and a groundwater model developed using Visual MODFLOW software. The seepage model was applied to a 38 km length of the tail reach of the Trimmu\u2013Sidhnai (T-S) link canal passing through a severely waterlogged area of 32,000 ha, with a water table within 0\u20131.5 m from the ground surface; this was to quantify the canal seepage under the present condition (without any intervention) and with the interventions of a concrete lining of the complete prism of the T-S link canal and concrete side protection of the T-S link canal, with the canal bed unlined. The groundwater model evaluated the effectiveness of three waterlogging management interventions, which included: (i) the rehabilitation of the 43 existing drainage tube wells, (ii) the rehabilitation of the existing surface drains, and (iii) a combination of the rehabilitation of the 43 existing drainage tube wells and the rehabilitation of the existing surface drains. The seepage modeling revealed that the concrete lining intervention can reduce 50% of the seepage of the T-S link canal, whereas the concrete side protection intervention can reduce only 21% of the canal seepage. The groundwater modeling revealed that the waterlogging management intervention of the rehabilitation of the 43 drainage tube wells and surface drains can lower the groundwater level from 139.2 to 138.3 m (0.9 m drop), resulting in the mitigation of waterlogging in 45% (14,400 ha) of the severely waterlogged area. The present study recommends that complete concrete lining of the T-S link canal has a huge potential to reduce seepage from the canal, and the combination of the rehabilitation of the 43 drainage tube wells and surface drains also offers a great potential for controlling waterlogging. This intervention can also be considered to mitigate waterlogging from the severely waterlogged area. Cost-effectiveness analysis of the concrete lining of the T-S link canal, the rehabilitation of the 43 existing drainage tube wells, and the rehabilitation of the existing surface drains need to be performed for decision-making and selection of the most cost-effective intervention for implementation. A study needs to be conducted for the development and evaluation of economical and socio-technically feasible and acceptable preventive waterlogging management interventions, including the improved management of irrigation systems, improved irrigation management practices at the farm, improved conjunctive management of surface and groundwater, and improved management of drainage systems at the primary, secondary, and tertiary canal command levels.",

        "dc:description": "The present study focused on the development and application of two computer numerical models, namely, a seepage model developed using SEEP/W software and a groundwater model developed using Visual MODFLOW software. The seepage model was applied to a 38 km length of the tail reach of the Trimmu\u2013Sidhnai (T-S) link canal passing through a severely waterlogged area of 32,000 ha, with a water table within 0\u20131.5 m from the ground surface; this was to quantify the canal seepage under the present condition (without any intervention) and with the interventions of a concrete lining of the complete prism of the T-S link canal and concrete side protection of the T-S link canal, with the canal bed unlined. The groundwater model evaluated the effectiveness of three waterlogging management interventions, which included: (i) the rehabilitation of the 43 existing drainage tube wells, (ii) the rehabilitation of the existing surface drains, and (iii) a combination of the rehabilitation of the 43 existing drainage tube wells and the rehabilitation of the existing surface drains. The seepage modeling revealed that the concrete lining intervention can reduce 50% of the seepage of the T-S link canal, whereas the concrete side protection intervention can reduce only 21% of the canal seepage. The groundwater modeling revealed that the waterlogging management intervention of the rehabilitation of the 43 drainage tube wells and surface drains can lower the groundwater level from 139.2 to 138.3 m (0.9 m drop), resulting in the mitigation of waterlogging in 45% (14,400 ha) of the severely waterlogged area. The present study recommends that complete concrete lining of the T-S link canal has a huge potential to reduce seepage from the canal, and the combination of the rehabilitation of the 43 drainage tube wells and surface drains also offers a great potential for controlling waterlogging. This intervention can also be considered to mitigate waterlogging from the severely waterlogged area. Cost-effectiveness analysis of the concrete lining of the T-S link canal, the rehabilitation of the 43 existing drainage tube wells, and the rehabilitation of the existing surface drains need to be performed for decision-making and selection of the most cost-effective intervention for implementation. A study needs to be conducted for the development and evaluation of economical and socio-technically feasible and acceptable preventive waterlogging management interventions, including the improved management of irrigation systems, improved irrigation management practices at the farm, improved conjunctive management of surface and groundwater, and improved management of drainage systems at the primary, secondary, and tertiary canal command levels.",
