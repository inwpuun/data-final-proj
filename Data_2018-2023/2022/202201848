                "abstracts": "© 2022, Walailak University. All rights reserved.Gingers is widely used as the complimentary household herbal medicine since it promotes varieties of health-protective effects including anti-hyperlipidemia and anti-hypertension. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 30-day ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae) ingestion on lipid and glucose profiles and blood pressures in hypertensive older women. The randomized double-blinded ginger consumption was designed in normotensive and hypertensive older women. Thirty-two female volunteers were randomly allocated into 4 groups of normotensives and hypertensives without and with ginger consumption, named as normotensive control (NC); normotensive with ginger consumption (NG); hypertensive control (HC) and hypertensive with ginger consumption (HG). On daily basis, the ginger-treated groups (NG and HG) ingested ginger powder at 75 mg/kgBW/day dissolved in 150 mL water after breakfast whereas control groups (NC and HC) received 150 mL water only for 30 days. Data were collected, in the morning, at pre-and post-intervention. Blood lipids, including cholesterol (chol), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoproteins (HDL), and low density lipoproteins (LDL), glucose levels and blood pressures were evaluated and compared from pre-and post-interventions. The results showed that 30-day ingestion of ginger exerted no change in normotensive groups, where alterations of blood lipid profiles were found in hypertensive groups. Both hypertensive groups (HC and HG) showed the significant reductions in SBP (p < 0.05), however, HC showed significantly increase in blood TG and LDL. HG group showed the reduction in TG and unchanged in LDL. There were no significant differences in chol, HDL, glucose levels and health-related performance from either within or between-groups comparisons (p > 0.05). This study primarily shows the minimal duration of 30-day ingestion of dissolved ginger on lowering systolic blood pressure and triglycerides but plays no roles in glycemic control in hypertensive subjects. Ginger might possibly play an important alternative role in alleviating certain health risks in the hypertensive aged females. To build up confidence on its therapeutic effect, more sample size of this local herb is needed in further investigation.",

        "dc:description": "Gingers is widely used as the complimentary household herbal medicine since it promotes varieties of health-protective effects including anti-hyperlipidemia and anti-hypertension. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 30-day ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae) ingestion on lipid and glucose profiles and blood pressures in hypertensive older women. The randomized double-blinded ginger consumption was designed in normotensive and hypertensive older women. Thirty-two female volunteers were randomly allocated into 4 groups of normotensives and hypertensives without and with ginger consumption, named as normotensive control (NC); normotensive with ginger consumption (NG); hypertensive control (HC) and hypertensive with ginger consumption (HG). On daily basis, the ginger-treated groups (NG and HG) ingested ginger powder at 75 mg/kgBW/day dissolved in 150 mL water after breakfast whereas control groups (NC and HC) received 150 mL water only for 30 days. Data were collected, in the morning, at pre-and post-intervention. Blood lipids, including cholesterol (chol), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoproteins (HDL), and low density lipoproteins (LDL), glucose levels and blood pressures were evaluated and compared from pre-and post-interventions. The results showed that 30-day ingestion of ginger exerted no change in normotensive groups, where alterations of blood lipid profiles were found in hypertensive groups. Both hypertensive groups (HC and HG) showed the significant reductions in SBP (p < 0.05), however, HC showed significantly increase in blood TG and LDL. HG group showed the reduction in TG and unchanged in LDL. There were no significant differences in chol, HDL, glucose levels and health-related performance from either within or between-groups comparisons (p > 0.05). This study primarily shows the minimal duration of 30-day ingestion of dissolved ginger on lowering systolic blood pressure and triglycerides but plays no roles in glycemic control in hypertensive subjects. Ginger might possibly play an important alternative role in alleviating certain health risks in the hypertensive aged females. To build up confidence on its therapeutic effect, more sample size of this local herb is needed in further investigation.",
