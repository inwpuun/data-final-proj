                "abstracts": "© 2022 by the authors.Stress is associated with cardiovascular disease. One accepted mechanism is autonomic imbalance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS) on cardiac autonomic control, cardiac structure and renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) activity in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The CMS model provides a more realistic simulation of daily stress. The animals were divided into control and CMS, and were exposed to 4-week mild stressors. The electrocardiogram recording, sucrose intake and parameters related to stress, cardiac alterations and RAAS were determined. The results showed that CMS had lower body weight and higher sucrose intake. The heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that CMS increased autonomic activity without affecting its balance. The increased RAAS activity with upregulated angiotensin type 1 receptor mRNA expression was shown in CMS. The increased sympathetic activity or RAAS was correlated with stress. Moreover, the altered cardiac structure (i.e., heart weight and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area) were correlated with stress-, sympathetic- and RAAS-related parameters. These indicated that CMS-induced cardiac hypertrophy was the result of both sympathetic and RAAS activation. Therefore, it could be concluded that 4-week CMS in male rats induced negative emotion as shown by increased sucrose intake, and increased cardiac autonomic and RAAS activities, which may be responsible for mild cardiac hypertrophy. The cardiac hypertrophy herein was possibly in an adaptive, not pathological, stage, and the cardiac autonomic function was preserved as the autonomic activities were in balance.",

        "dc:description": "Stress is associated with cardiovascular disease. One accepted mechanism is autonomic imbalance. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS) on cardiac autonomic control, cardiac structure and renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) activity in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The CMS model provides a more realistic simulation of daily stress. The animals were divided into control and CMS, and were exposed to 4-week mild stressors. The electrocardiogram recording, sucrose intake and parameters related to stress, cardiac alterations and RAAS were determined. The results showed that CMS had lower body weight and higher sucrose intake. The heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that CMS increased autonomic activity without affecting its balance. The increased RAAS activity with upregulated angiotensin type 1 receptor mRNA expression was shown in CMS. The increased sympathetic activity or RAAS was correlated with stress. Moreover, the altered cardiac structure (i.e., heart weight and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area) were correlated with stress-, sympathetic- and RAAS-related parameters. These indicated that CMS-induced cardiac hypertrophy was the result of both sympathetic and RAAS activation. Therefore, it could be concluded that 4-week CMS in male rats induced negative emotion as shown by increased sucrose intake, and increased cardiac autonomic and RAAS activities, which may be responsible for mild cardiac hypertrophy. The cardiac hypertrophy herein was possibly in an adaptive, not pathological, stage, and the cardiac autonomic function was preserved as the autonomic activities were in balance.",
