                "abstracts": "© Experimental Biology and Medicine 2022.The coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has impacted the health of almost everyone, including changes in their salivary microbiota. Since 2019, there has been an increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases in Thailand. Therefore, COVID-19 active case finding is important for early detection and epidemic control. Moreover, the dynamic changes of salivary bacteriome in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are largely unknown. This research aimed to investigate and compare the salivary bacteriome and the co-infectious bacterial pathogens in the asymptomatic COVID-19 positive group to the negative group, based on novel nanopore sequencing. This cohort was a cross-sectional study including saliva samples collected from 82 asymptomatic participants (39 COVID-19 positive and 43 COVID-19 negative cases). All samples were sequenced for the full-length bacterial 16S rDNA. The alpha and beta diversity analyses were not significantly different between groups. The three major species in salivary bacteriome including Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mitis, and Prevotella melaninogenica were observed in both groups. Interestingly, Lautropia mirabilis was a significantly enriched species in the saliva of the asymptomatic COVID-19-positive cases based on linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis. The results suggested that L. mirabilis was a co-infectious agent in the asymptomatic COVID-19 group. However, the potential role of L. mirabilis should be validated in further experimental studies.",

        "dc:description": "The coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has impacted the health of almost everyone, including changes in their salivary microbiota. Since 2019, there has been an increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases in Thailand. Therefore, COVID-19 active case finding is important for early detection and epidemic control. Moreover, the dynamic changes of salivary bacteriome in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are largely unknown. This research aimed to investigate and compare the salivary bacteriome and the co-infectious bacterial pathogens in the asymptomatic COVID-19 positive group to the negative group, based on novel nanopore sequencing. This cohort was a cross-sectional study including saliva samples collected from 82 asymptomatic participants (39 COVID-19 positive and 43 COVID-19 negative cases). All samples were sequenced for the full-length bacterial 16S rDNA. The alpha and beta diversity analyses were not significantly different between groups. The three major species in salivary bacteriome including Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mitis, and Prevotella melaninogenica were observed in both groups. Interestingly, Lautropia mirabilis was a significantly enriched species in the saliva of the asymptomatic COVID-19-positive cases based on linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis. The results suggested that L. mirabilis was a co-infectious agent in the asymptomatic COVID-19 group. However, the potential role of L. mirabilis should be validated in further experimental studies.",
