                "abstracts": "© 2022 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Consumer demand for fermented foods with a well-balanced nutrient profile has been increasing owing to their ability to prevent chronic diseases as well as their functional, nutritional, and nutraceutical benefits. Among those functional foods, miso is a well-known traditional fermented food with a distinctive savory flavor and aroma that is most commonly used as a seasoning in miso soup. Among different fermented products, miso is derived from soybeans and grains as a result of the activities of Koji enzymes and beneficial microbes. Additionally, the microbial community of miso is thought to be crucial in enhancing its distinct flavor and texture as well as its nutritional properties. Despite the importance of microorganisms in the production of miso, there has been relatively little research done to characterize and describe the nutritional and medicinal potential of miso. In this review, the potential therapeutic properties, i.e., anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiobesity, of miso have been discussed comprehensively. This review envisions the production technology, its history, microbial population, nutritional properties, and the potential health benefits of miso associated with its consumption.",

Among those functional foods, miso is a well-known traditional fermented food with a distinctive savory flavor and aroma that is most commonly used as a seasoning in miso soup. Among different fermented products, miso is derived from soybeans and grains as a result of the activities of Koji enzymes and beneficial microbes. Additionally, the microbial community of miso is thought to be crucial in enhancing its distinct flavor and texture as well as its nutritional properties. Despite the importance of microorganisms in the production of miso, there has been relatively little research done to characterize and describe the nutritional and medicinal potential of miso. In this review, the potential therapeutic properties, i.e., anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiobesity, of miso have been discussed comprehensively. This review envisions the production technology, its history, microbial population, nutritional properties, and the potential health benefits of miso associated with its consumption.",
