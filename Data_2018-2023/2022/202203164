                "citation-title": "Legacy of Migration: the Muslim community in Bangkok",
                "abstracts": "© 2022 Tallinn University. All rights reserved.Although Thai Buddhism is the dominant religion in Bangkok, the capital is ethnically and religiously diverse. In particular, there is a large community of Muslims. This paper examines the Muslim community in Bangkok, focusing on the Minburi district. Most Thai Muslims in this district are of Pattani descent, having migrated to the area since 1786, bringing with them the common cultural practices of Thailand\u2019s southernmost provinces and Malaysia. The complex social, cultural, and political structures of Bangkok are rooted in the complexities of different religions, migration phenomena, and development discourses. The international migration of Muslims to the Minburi district resulted from state policies, economic and cultural factors, while existing networks cultivate a contemporary sense of mobility. To explore the causes of the migration and its legacy, this paper poses two research questions: 1) How have members of the Muslim community in the Minburi district settled through the migration and development process? 2) How do the Muslims in the Minburi district sustain and negotiate their identities through activities and changes within the community? To answer these questions, the paper used semi-structured interviews, observation and secondary data analysis techniques. The paper argues that through a history of migration and development, Muslims in Minburi have constructed identities and interpersonal networks within their community. Once unoccupied farming land, Minburi was transformed into an identifiable ethnic and religious community, which is currently undergoing the gradual process of becoming a multi-racial community. This reflects that historical entities and development programmes have shaped individual and community identities. Islamic identities and faiths remain salient in the district despite other dominant norms in Bangkok as a whole. The findings demonstrate the ways in which Muslims have negotiated their identities in the face of changing development paradigms and migration policies since the late 18th century. Transitions at different times underpin the Minburi community in its state of becoming or as an assemblage. Each period of change has challenged their identity and ability to consolidate their community. This paper contributes to our understanding of the migration phenomenon and the process by which identities flow and communities become dynamic.",

        "dc:description": "Although Thai Buddhism is the dominant religion in Bangkok, the capital is ethnically and religiously diverse. In particular, there is a large community of Muslims. This paper examines the Muslim community in Bangkok, focusing on the Minburi district. Most Thai Muslims in this district are of Pattani descent, having migrated to the area since 1786, bringing with them the common cultural practices of Thailand\u2019s southernmost provinces and Malaysia. The complex social, cultural, and political structures of Bangkok are rooted in the complexities of different religions, migration phenomena, and development discourses. The international migration of Muslims to the Minburi district resulted from state policies, economic and cultural factors, while existing networks cultivate a contemporary sense of mobility. To explore the causes of the migration and its legacy, this paper poses two research questions: 1) How have members of the Muslim community in the Minburi district settled through the migration and development process? 2) How do the Muslims in the Minburi district sustain and negotiate their identities through activities and changes within the community? To answer these questions, the paper used semi-structured interviews, observation and secondary data analysis techniques. The paper argues that through a history of migration and development, Muslims in Minburi have constructed identities and interpersonal networks within their community. Once unoccupied farming land, Minburi was transformed into an identifiable ethnic and religious community, which is currently undergoing the gradual process of becoming a multi-racial community. This reflects that historical entities and development programmes have shaped individual and community identities. Islamic identities and faiths remain salient in the district despite other dominant norms in Bangkok as a whole. The findings demonstrate the ways in which Muslims have negotiated their identities in the face of changing development paradigms and migration policies since the late 18th century. Transitions at different times underpin the Minburi community in its state of becoming or as an assemblage. Each period of change has challenged their identity and ability to consolidate their community. This paper contributes to our understanding of the migration phenomenon and the process by which identities flow and communities become dynamic.",
