                "abstracts": "© 2022 by the authors.Hydrothermally assisted magnetic ZnO/Carbon nanocomposites were prepared using the selective biowaste of pomelo orange. Initially, the carbon aerogel (CA) was prepared hydrothermally followed by a freeze-drying method. Furthermore, the iron oxide nanoparticles were deposited onto the surface of carbon using the co-precipitation method and we obtained magnetic carbon nanocomposite, i.e., Fe3O4/C (MNC). Moreover, the ZnO photocatalysts were incorporated onto the surface of MNC composites using a hydrothermal process, and we obtained ZnO/MNC composites. The ZnO/MNC (55%), ZnO/MNC (65%) and ZnO/MNC (75%) composites were prepared by a similar experimental method in order to change the weight ratio of ZnO NPs. Using a similar synthetic procedure, the standard ZnO and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared without the addition of CA. The experimental results were derived from several analytical techniques, such as: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UV). The synthesized carbon, ZnO, Fe3O4, ZnO/MNC (55%), ZnO/MNC (65%) and ZnO/MNC (75%) composites were examined through the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation (VLI). The obtained results revealed that the composites were more active than carbon, ZnO and Fe3O4. In particular, the ZnO/MNC (75%) composites showed more activity than the rest of the composites. Furthermore, the recycling abilities of the prepared ZnO/MNC (75%) composites were examined through the degradation of MB under identical conditions and the activity remained constant up to the fifth cycle. The synthetic procedure and practical applications proposed here can be used in chemical industries, biomedical fields and energy applications.",

        "dc:description": "Hydrothermally assisted magnetic ZnO/Carbon nanocomposites were prepared using the selective biowaste of pomelo orange. Initially, the carbon aerogel (CA) was prepared hydrothermally followed by a freeze-drying method. Furthermore, the iron oxide nanoparticles were deposited onto the surface of carbon using the co-precipitation method and we obtained magnetic carbon nanocomposite, i.e., Fe3O4/C (MNC). Moreover, the ZnO photocatalysts were incorporated onto the surface of MNC composites using a hydrothermal process, and we obtained ZnO/MNC composites. The ZnO/MNC (55%), ZnO/MNC (65%) and ZnO/MNC (75%) composites were prepared by a similar experimental method in order to change the weight ratio of ZnO NPs. Using a similar synthetic procedure, the standard ZnO and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared without the addition of CA. The experimental results were derived from several analytical techniques, such as: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UV). The synthesized carbon, ZnO, Fe3O4, ZnO/MNC (55%), ZnO/MNC (65%) and ZnO/MNC (75%) composites were examined through the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible-light irradiation (VLI). The obtained results revealed that the composites were more active than carbon, ZnO and Fe3O4. In particular, the ZnO/MNC (75%) composites showed more activity than the rest of the composites. Furthermore, the recycling abilities of the prepared ZnO/MNC (75%) composites were examined through the degradation of MB under identical conditions and the activity remained constant up to the fifth cycle. The synthetic procedure and practical applications proposed here can be used in chemical industries, biomedical fields and energy applications.",
