                "abstracts": "© 2022 by the authors.Full-scale testing of multiple span girders is scarce in the literature, often related to the complexity of loading setup and time constraints. The importance of full-scale tests is manifested in the fact that useful information regarding failure mechanisms can be obtained. In addition, important guidelines can be established for structural designers. Further, results from full-scale tests can help establish constitutive laws for various mechanisms involved in the response of actual structures. The structural performance of individual members can be assessed by monitoring their strains at service and ultimate loads. This study presents a comparison of experimentally monitored strains on longitudinal steel bars, stirrups, and prestressing tendons embedded in single and multi-span full-scale precast pre-tensioned girders. These girders were constructed and detailed to simulate the response of newly proposed straddle-type monorail girders. Single-span girders were tested under monotonic two-point service and ultimate loads, whereas multi-span girders were tested under both two- and four-point service and ultimate load. It was revealed that longitudinal steel and prestressing tendon strains monitored within single-span girders at service and ultimate loads were significantly higher than those recorded at corresponding locations in multi-span girders.",

        "dc:description": "Full-scale testing of multiple span girders is scarce in the literature, often related to the complexity of loading setup and time constraints. The importance of full-scale tests is manifested in the fact that useful information regarding failure mechanisms can be obtained. In addition, important guidelines can be established for structural designers. Further, results from full-scale tests can help establish constitutive laws for various mechanisms involved in the response of actual structures. The structural performance of individual members can be assessed by monitoring their strains at service and ultimate loads. This study presents a comparison of experimentally monitored strains on longitudinal steel bars, stirrups, and prestressing tendons embedded in single and multi-span full-scale precast pre-tensioned girders. These girders were constructed and detailed to simulate the response of newly proposed straddle-type monorail girders. Single-span girders were tested under monotonic two-point service and ultimate loads, whereas multi-span girders were tested under both two- and four-point service and ultimate load. It was revealed that longitudinal steel and prestressing tendon strains monitored within single-span girders at service and ultimate loads were significantly higher than those recorded at corresponding locations in multi-span girders.",
