                "abstracts": "© 2022 Elsevier LtdUnder the pressure of the existing world population growth trends, the dercreasing pastoral fields and the increasing duration and incidences of drought and heat stress, the potash fertilizers demand dramaticly increase to enhance the world food production. Asia currently consumes 40% of the world's potash market, yet 70% of world potash exports come from mines in Canada and Europe. Weak collective efforts to produce potassium fertilizers economically pose the risk of global shortages of potash goods and threatening global food security. While the Khorat Plateau in Northeastern Thailand is noted to contain active and promising regional potash deposits, developing a proper potash industry in the region has largely been unsuccessful due to major constraints such as the challenge of establishing a brine disposal solution. This study demonstrates the performance of deep well injection (DWI) as an environmentally friendly alternative to secure waste brine production from the potash mine. The groundwater numerical model demonstrates the movement and penetration of the concentrate during and after deep well injection. The boundary condition was utilized from the regional hydrogeology data. The waste brine injection is based on the waste products of the mine factory. Our simulation shows that the DWI can isolate waste brine with freshwater by injecting it into the deep formation based on the geologic structure and properties analysis. With high porosity and low specific yield, the Khok Kruat formation within Khrat Basin shows a high potential injection rate of 200,000 m3/day, which is 200 times higher than current water brine production rates. Moreover, the salinity can easily dissolve into the target domain with specific formation properties. Hence, the DWI not only boosts the potash industry's image in the long term but also enable sustainable potash mining development in the region. Finally, we recommend that government agencies with regulatory oversight over the DWI must promote further research associated with site characterization, well construction and injection technologies, and monitoring tools in the long term.",

        "dc:description": "Under the pressure of the existing world population growth trends, the dercreasing pastoral fields and the increasing duration and incidences of drought and heat stress, the potash fertilizers demand dramaticly increase to enhance the world food production. Asia currently consumes 40% of the world's potash market, yet 70% of world potash exports come from mines in Canada and Europe. Weak collective efforts to produce potassium fertilizers economically pose the risk of global shortages of potash goods and threatening global food security. While the Khorat Plateau in Northeastern Thailand is noted to contain active and promising regional potash deposits, developing a proper potash industry in the region has largely been unsuccessful due to major constraints such as the challenge of establishing a brine disposal solution. This study demonstrates the performance of deep well injection (DWI) as an environmentally friendly alternative to secure waste brine production from the potash mine. The groundwater numerical model demonstrates the movement and penetration of the concentrate during and after deep well injection. The boundary condition was utilized from the regional hydrogeology data. The waste brine injection is based on the waste products of the mine factory. Our simulation shows that the DWI can isolate waste brine with freshwater by injecting it into the deep formation based on the geologic structure and properties analysis. With high porosity and low specific yield, the Khok Kruat formation within Khrat Basin shows a high potential injection rate of 200,000 m3/day, which is 200 times higher than current water brine production rates. Moreover, the salinity can easily dissolve into the target domain with specific formation properties. Hence, the DWI not only boosts the potash industry's image in the long term but also enable sustainable potash mining development in the region. Finally, we recommend that government agencies with regulatory oversight over the DWI must promote further research associated with site characterization, well construction and injection technologies, and monitoring tools in the long term.",
