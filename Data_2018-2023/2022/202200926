                "abstracts": "© Fuji Technology Press Ltd.Flooding is a major natural hazard that can cause significant damage to socioeconomic and ecological systems. This study presents an approach to pro-ducing the maximum flood inundation and flood duration maps over the Chao Phraya River Basin (CPRB), Thailand. An integrated numerical model and spatial analysis tool were utilized in this study. The Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was first used to simulate both river discharge and inundation depth. Then, the maximum flood inundation and flood duration maps with different return periods were estimated using a Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. The results illustrate that the flood inundation areas were spread out, starting from Nakhon Sawan Province, which is located in the central part of the basin. The maximum flood inundation depth could reach up to approximately 7.71, 8.28, and 8.78 m for the flood return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years, re-spectively. The results also indicate that the inundation areas over the CPRB could cover approximately 21,837, 23,392, and 24,533 km2 for flood return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years, respectively. The longest flood durations for return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years were approximately 159, 177, and 198 days, respectively. The longest flood duration occurred in the vicinity of the Nakhon Sawan. This study sug-gests that flood inundation areas and duration mapping could provide supporting information regarding the impacts caused by varying degrees of flood hazards and can be used to enhance comprehensive disaster risk management planning.",

This study presents an approach to pro-ducing the maximum flood inundation and flood duration maps over the Chao Phraya River Basin (CPRB), Thailand. An integrated numerical model and spatial analysis tool were utilized in this study. The Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was first used to simulate both river discharge and inundation depth. Then, the maximum flood inundation and flood duration maps with different return periods were estimated using a Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. The results illustrate that the flood inundation areas were spread out, starting from Nakhon Sawan Province, which is located in the central part of the basin. The maximum flood inundation depth could reach up to approximately 7.71, 8.28, and 8.78 m for the flood return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years, re-spectively. The results also indicate that the inundation areas over the CPRB could cover approximately 21,837, 23,392, and 24,533 km2 for flood return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years, respectively. The longest flood durations for return periods of 50, 100, and 200 years were approximately 159, 177, and 198 days, respectively. The longest flood duration occurred in the vicinity of the Nakhon Sawan. This study sug-gests that flood inundation areas and duration mapping could provide supporting information regarding the impacts caused by varying degrees of flood hazards and can be used to enhance comprehensive disaster risk management planning.",
