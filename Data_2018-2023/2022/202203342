                "abstracts": "© 2022 IEEE.Organizing music activities for the elderly is another way that supports their well-being. Angklung, an Indonesian musical instrument, has been used for music activities for the elderly in Thailand with the hand signs method. Unfortunately, music activity is not widely used because the experts with the hand sign skills are few and not enough for demanding in the aging healthcare. At the same time, technologies of remote systems using the Internet of Things (IoT) have been developed to assist the elderly in supporting and improving their quality of life. This paper will introduce 'Angklung Smart Band,' an IoT-based system to support Angklung music activities for the elderly in Thailand. This work aims at setting up Angklung music activities for the elderly by using technology instead of hand signs. The system is composed of a web application, IoT devices, and Angklung musical instruments connected together via a wireless network. We did a preliminary study with the experts to improve experiences and system performance. After that, we asked the music experts to use the smart band to conduct the music activities experiment with the elderly for three days and give us feedback. The results found that the smart band could assist the Angklung music experts and help with the shortage of music expertise in aged care facilities or nursing homes.",

Angklung, an Indonesian musical instrument, has been used for music activities for the elderly in Thailand with the hand signs method. Unfortunately, music activity is not widely used because the experts with the hand sign skills are few and not enough for demanding in the aging healthcare. At the same time, technologies of remote systems using the Internet of Things (IoT) have been developed to assist the elderly in supporting and improving their quality of life. This paper will introduce 'Angklung Smart Band,' an IoT-based system to support Angklung music activities for the elderly in Thailand. This work aims at setting up Angklung music activities for the elderly by using technology instead of hand signs. The system is composed of a web application, IoT devices, and Angklung musical instruments connected together via a wireless network. We did a preliminary study with the experts to improve experiences and system performance. After that, we asked the music experts to use the smart band to conduct the music activities experiment with the elderly for three days and give us feedback. The results found that the smart band could assist the Angklung music experts and help with the shortage of music expertise in aged care facilities or nursing homes.",
