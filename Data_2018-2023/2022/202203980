I would also like to thank all the respondents for their time, support, and consideration, to help me accomplish data collection, an important part of this work. I anticipate that this study will provide crucial insights for the Convention and Visitor Bureau regarding destinations, local destination stakeholders, accommodations, and meeting facilities, to collaborate and create strategies that are suitable to comply with the site selection attributes for domestic meetings. Considering the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic that limits international business delegates traveling to the country, domestic meetings may very well be the low-hanging fruit to sustain business continuity.",

As a practical contribution, this study recommends that destination policy managers increase meeting destination competitiveness in developing countries with expansive tourism infrastructure, such as Thailand.",

I would also like to thank all the respondents for their time, support, and consideration, to help me accomplish data collection, an important part of this work. I anticipate that this study will provide crucial insights for the Convention and Visitor Bureau regarding destinations, local destination stakeholders, accommodations, and meeting facilities, to collaborate and create strategies that are suitable to comply with the site selection attributes for domestic meetings. Considering the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic that limits international business delegates traveling to the country, domestic meetings may very well be the low-hanging fruit to sustain business continuity.",

A mixed-methods research technique was employed to identify the important factors pertaining to the selection of meeting venues. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on factors with similar characteristics to identify seven new factor groups and 44 attributes. As a practical contribution, this study recommends that destination policy managers increase meeting destination competitiveness in developing countries with expansive tourism infrastructure, such as Thailand.",
