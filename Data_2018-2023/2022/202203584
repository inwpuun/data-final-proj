This study presents new insights into this issue through a scientometric process involving a case study of technologies for extending fruit shelf-life. The text mining software was utilized to analyze 3,131 Web of Science-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2020 as a means to glean the conceptual structure of current knowledge and conduct a social network analysis to explore scientific and publication activity. The findings were mapped onto a strategic diagram of research productivity and collaboration between players at the national, organizational, and individual levels. This research's main findings highlight that research on shelf-life technology is in continuous development, and academic institutions from China, Spain, and the U.S. are the core national players in this field. The results provide insights for further investigation to strengthen co-research and technological development programs in other fields. Researchers who are exploring networking opportunities can use the model and process presented as a guideline for identifying emerging and future research trends and formulating strategies.",

This study presents new insights into this issue through a scientometric process involving a case study of technologies for extending fruit shelf-life. The text mining software was utilized to analyze 3,131 Web of Science-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2020 as a means to glean the conceptual structure of current knowledge and conduct a social network analysis to explore scientific and publication activity. The findings were mapped onto a strategic diagram of research productivity and collaboration between players at the national, organizational, and individual levels. This research's main findings highlight that research on shelf-life technology is in continuous development, and academic institutions from China, Spain, and the U.S. are the core national players in this field. The results provide insights for further investigation to strengthen co-research and technological development programs in other fields. Researchers who are exploring networking opportunities can use the model and process presented as a guideline for identifying emerging and future research trends and formulating strategies.",
