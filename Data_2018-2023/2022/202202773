Three adult males were collected from a small breeding pond during our survey in July 2020. Based on molecular (two specimens) and morphological (three specimens) evidence, all three specimens from DPHPNP were identified as Tylototriton verrucosus Anderson, 1871, and were characterized by having a blackish background, orange to light orange brown color markings, segmented vertebral ridge, prominent rib nodules ranging from 13\u201315 warts, and rough skin with granules. Hence, this second record of T. verrucosus populations in Thailand confirms a range extension of this species in northern Indochina. Additionally, the morphological variation and conservation status are discussed for the populations from Thailand.",

Three adult males were collected from a small breeding pond during our survey in July 2020. Based on molecular (two specimens) and morphological (three specimens) evidence, all three specimens from DPHPNP were identified as Tylototriton verrucosus Anderson, 1871, and were characterized by having a blackish background, orange to light orange brown color markings, segmented vertebral ridge, prominent rib nodules ranging from 13\u201315 warts, and rough skin with granules. Hence, this second record of T. verrucosus populations in Thailand confirms a range extension of this species in northern Indochina. Additionally, the morphological variation and conservation status are discussed for the populations from Thailand.",
