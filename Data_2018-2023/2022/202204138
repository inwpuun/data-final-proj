                "abstracts": "© 2022 American Dairy Science AssociationGenome-wide association studies are a powerful tool to identify genomic regions and variants associated with phenotypes. However, only limited mutual confirmation from different studies is available. The objectives of this study were to identify genomic regions as well as genes and pathways associated with the first-lactation milk, fat, protein, and total solid yields; fat, protein, and total solid percentage; and somatic cell score (SCS) in a Thai dairy cattle population. Effects of SNPs were estimated by a weighted single-step GWAS, which back-solved the genomic breeding values predicted using single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) fitting a single-trait random regression test-day model. Genomic regions that explained at least 0.5% of the total genetic variance were selected for further analyses of candidate genes. Despite the small number of genotyped animals, genomic predictions led to an improvement in the accuracy over the traditional BLUP. Genomic predictions using weighted ssGBLUP were slightly better than the ssGBLUP. The genomic regions associated with milk production traits contained 210 candidate genes on 19 chromosomes [Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 1 to 7, 9, 11 to 16, 20 to 21, 26 to 27 and 29], whereas 21 candidate genes on 3 chromosomes (BTA 11, 16, and 21) were associated with SCS. Many genomic regions explained a small fraction of the genetic variance, indicating polygenic inheritance of the studied traits. Several candidate genes coincided with previous reports for milk production traits in Holstein cattle, especially a large region of genes on BTA14. We identified 141 and 5 novel genes related to milk production and SCS, respectively. These novel genes were also found to be functionally related to heat tolerance (e.g., SLC45A2, IRAG1, and LOC101902172), longevity (e.g., SYT10 and LOC101903327), and fertility (e.g., PAG1). These findings may be attributed to indirect selection in our population. Identified biological networks including intracellular cell transportation and protein catabolism implicate milk production, whereas the immunological pathways such as lymphocyte activation are closely related to SCS. Further studies are required to validate our findings before exploiting them in genomic selection.",

        "dc:description": "Genome-wide association studies are a powerful tool to identify genomic regions and variants associated with phenotypes. However, only limited mutual confirmation from different studies is available. The objectives of this study were to identify genomic regions as well as genes and pathways associated with the first-lactation milk, fat, protein, and total solid yields; fat, protein, and total solid percentage; and somatic cell score (SCS) in a Thai dairy cattle population. Effects of SNPs were estimated by a weighted single-step GWAS, which back-solved the genomic breeding values predicted using single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) fitting a single-trait random regression test-day model. Genomic regions that explained at least 0.5% of the total genetic variance were selected for further analyses of candidate genes. Despite the small number of genotyped animals, genomic predictions led to an improvement in the accuracy over the traditional BLUP. Genomic predictions using weighted ssGBLUP were slightly better than the ssGBLUP. The genomic regions associated with milk production traits contained 210 candidate genes on 19 chromosomes [Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 1 to 7, 9, 11 to 16, 20 to 21, 26 to 27 and 29], whereas 21 candidate genes on 3 chromosomes (BTA 11, 16, and 21) were associated with SCS. Many genomic regions explained a small fraction of the genetic variance, indicating polygenic inheritance of the studied traits. Several candidate genes coincided with previous reports for milk production traits in Holstein cattle, especially a large region of genes on BTA14. We identified 141 and 5 novel genes related to milk production and SCS, respectively. These novel genes were also found to be functionally related to heat tolerance (e.g., SLC45A2, IRAG1, and LOC101902172), longevity (e.g., SYT10 and LOC101903327), and fertility (e.g., PAG1). These findings may be attributed to indirect selection in our population. Identified biological networks including intracellular cell transportation and protein catabolism implicate milk production, whereas the immunological pathways such as lymphocyte activation are closely related to SCS. Further studies are required to validate our findings before exploiting them in genomic selection.",
