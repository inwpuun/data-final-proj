The article is published with Open Access at https://www.temjournal.com/This research developed a cloud-based adaptive learning system to enhance the creative problem-solving efficiency of learners based on their ability levels. The difficulty level of learning activities in the system would be adjusted to fit the creative problem-solving ability of each learner, while there would also be knowledge sharing activities to create new ideas. This cloud-based adaptive learning system has six components, which are 1) adaptive learning system, 2) cloud tools, 3) topic of problem, 4) teaching and learning approach, 5) assessment, and 6) knowledge sharing. The system consists of four steps, which are 1) search (S), 2) solve (S), 3) create (C), and 4) share (S). The system was designed based on the survey results of 55 undergraduate lecturers and 478 undergraduates, then an experiment was conducted. The results showed that creative problem-solving scores after using the system were higher than the before using it, at a significance level of.05. The results were analyzed using F test and found a significance difference of the creative problem-solving scores, which after using the system were higher than before using the system at the significant level of.05",

The difficulty level of learning activities in the system would be adjusted to fit the creative problem-solving ability of each learner, while there would also be knowledge sharing activities to create new ideas. This cloud-based adaptive learning system has six components, which are 1) adaptive learning system, 2) cloud tools, 3) topic of problem, 4) teaching and learning approach, 5) assessment, and 6) knowledge sharing. The system consists of four steps, which are 1) search (S), 2) solve (S), 3) create (C), and 4) share (S). The system was designed based on the survey results of 55 undergraduate lecturers and 478 undergraduates, then an experiment was conducted. The results showed that creative problem-solving scores after using the system were higher than the before using it, at a significance level of.05. The results were analyzed using F test and found a significance difference of the creative problem-solving scores, which after using the system were higher than before using the system at the significant level of.05",
