The participants were followed until the course for TB treatment was completed. There were 11 cases with unsuccessful treatment outcome for pulmonary TB (10.7%) of which 5 participants were lost to follow-up (so they did not complete their treatment for TB), 4 participants were discharged as treatment failure, and 2 participants died before completing their treatment (dead by pulmonary TB). The percentage of unsuccessful treatment supports the results reported by WHO. When analyzed by the Chi-square test, both persistent depression and anxiety were factors associated with unsuccessful treatment. According to the univariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia, patients who had been previously treated or had recurrent pulmonary TB, and patients with comorbidity were associated with unsuccessful treatment but these factors were not significant in the multivariate analysis.",

                "abstracts": "© 2022 Tuberculosis Association of IndiaBackground: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in Thailand. TB causes chronic disease which may cause physical disability, mental and socioeconomic problems in TB patients. Mental disorders may occur after TB infection or co-exist with the disease. This study assessed the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pulmonary TB patients and its association with treatment outcome. Methods: This is a single-center prospective study. Pulmonary TB patients who were treated at a tertiary hospital, in both outpatient and in-patient settings, were enrolled into the study. Demographic data and Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score at baseline and at least 2 months after diagnosis were collected to evaluate the probability of depression and anxiety. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the data. Association between suspicious mental disorder and treatment outcome were evaluated at the end of each participant's treatment. Results: One hundred and three participants were enrolled into the study on March 2018 to October 2019. The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety (Thai HADS score ≥11 from both test) were 7.8% and 6.8%, respectively. Unsuccessful treatment outcome rate was 10.7% (11/103). From the multivariate analysis, people previously treated/relapsed (aOR (95%CI): 7.04 (1.19\u201341.85), p = 0.03) and probable depression/anxiety with Thai HADS score ≥11 (10.12 (1.54\u201366.45), p = 0.02) were associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome. Conclusions: In this study, Thai HADS score could identify probable depression and anxiety among pulmonary TB patients, and its association with unfavorable treatment outcome. Clinicians should keep in mind that pulmonary TB can affect the mental status of the patients and therefore, should evaluate them and provide appropriate treatment.",

The participants were followed until the course for TB treatment was completed. There were 11 cases with unsuccessful treatment outcome for pulmonary TB (10.7%) of which 5 participants were lost to follow-up (so they did not complete their treatment for TB), 4 participants were discharged as treatment failure, and 2 participants died before completing their treatment (dead by pulmonary TB). The percentage of unsuccessful treatment supports the results reported by WHO. When analyzed by the Chi-square test, both persistent depression and anxiety were factors associated with unsuccessful treatment. According to the univariate analysis, hypoalbuminemia, patients who had been previously treated or had recurrent pulmonary TB, and patients with comorbidity were associated with unsuccessful treatment but these factors were not significant in the multivariate analysis.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in Thailand. TB causes chronic disease which may cause physical disability, mental and socioeconomic problems in TB patients. Mental disorders may occur after TB infection or co-exist with the disease. This study assessed the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pulmonary TB patients and its association with treatment outcome. Methods: This is a single-center prospective study. Pulmonary TB patients who were treated at a tertiary hospital, in both outpatient and in-patient settings, were enrolled into the study. Demographic data and Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score at baseline and at least 2 months after diagnosis were collected to evaluate the probability of depression and anxiety. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the data. Association between suspicious mental disorder and treatment outcome were evaluated at the end of each participant's treatment. Results: One hundred and three participants were enrolled into the study on March 2018 to October 2019. The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety (Thai HADS score ≥11 from both test) were 7.8% and 6.8%, respectively. Unsuccessful treatment outcome rate was 10.7% (11/103). From the multivariate analysis, people previously treated/relapsed (aOR (95%CI): 7.04 (1.19\u201341.85), p = 0.03) and probable depression/anxiety with Thai HADS score ≥11 (10.12 (1.54\u201366.45), p = 0.02) were associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome. Conclusions: In this study, Thai HADS score could identify probable depression and anxiety among pulmonary TB patients, and its association with unfavorable treatment outcome. Clinicians should keep in mind that pulmonary TB can affect the mental status of the patients and therefore, should evaluate them and provide appropriate treatment.",
