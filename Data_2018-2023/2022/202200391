In this study, we investigated the effects of maize varieties and their root traits on the diversity and community composition of soil arthropods over time. Soil arthropods and root traits were evaluated before planting and at 30 and 60 days after planting in four maize varieties with different root growth angles and lateral root branching. Arthropod diversity declined from day 0 to 30 but recovered by day 60 with the development of maize roots. Two maize varieties (Nei 542018 and Nei 542022) exhibited lower brace and crown root angles, and arthropod taxon richness was greater in these two varieties than in others. The highest abundance of detritivores and predators was found in one of the maize varieties (Nei 542018) which, in addition to lower root angle, attained greater root diameter and lateral root branching and length. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil arthropod composition was correlated with crown root angle. Our findings highlight the importance of root traits, especially the angle of the roots, to enhance arthropod biodiversity in the rhizosphere ecosystem.",

        "dc:description": "While ecological roles of rhizosphere arthropods are well documented, little is known about the relationship between the development of plant roots and soil arthropod communities in agroecosystems. In this study, we investigated the effects of maize varieties and their root traits on the diversity and community composition of soil arthropods over time. Soil arthropods and root traits were evaluated before planting and at 30 and 60 days after planting in four maize varieties with different root growth angles and lateral root branching. Arthropod diversity declined from day 0 to 30 but recovered by day 60 with the development of maize roots. Two maize varieties (Nei 542018 and Nei 542022) exhibited lower brace and crown root angles, and arthropod taxon richness was greater in these two varieties than in others. The highest abundance of detritivores and predators was found in one of the maize varieties (Nei 542018) which, in addition to lower root angle, attained greater root diameter and lateral root branching and length. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil arthropod composition was correlated with crown root angle. Our findings highlight the importance of root traits, especially the angle of the roots, to enhance arthropod biodiversity in the rhizosphere ecosystem.",
