                "abstracts": "© The Author(s) 2022.Qualitative scholars are increasingly engaged in global research where members of the research team are from different countries and cultures and have different primary languages. However, in-depth descriptions of how to work as a transnational team successfully and rigorously are scarce. Using a collaboration between Stanford University in the US and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand as a case example, we present the nuances and challenges experienced in this research collaboration, as well as the strategies employed to optimize the validity and reliability of the study findings. While we started our data analysis following a more typical qualitative analysis path, shortcomings of this approach brought us to explore an alternative, involving data review and coding by transnational coding sub-teams. This approach was better able to illuminate cultural nuances, address coding discrepancies, and bring forward discussions to enhance interpretation and validity of findings. We describe our collaborative and iterative approach, and highlight methodological implications around team composition, language nuances and translation challenges, our coding process involving transnational coding sub-teams, and important considerations for managing team dynamics (e.g., power and hierarchy) and the partnership process and engagement over time. Moreover, we highlight the benefits of integrating insiders and outsiders throughout the research process, from data collection to coding and interpretation. Our process can serve as a model for similar transnational teams seeking ways to fully benefit from cross-cultural research collaborations.",

However, in-depth descriptions of how to work as a transnational team successfully and rigorously are scarce. Using a collaboration between Stanford University in the US and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand as a case example, we present the nuances and challenges experienced in this research collaboration, as well as the strategies employed to optimize the validity and reliability of the study findings. While we started our data analysis following a more typical qualitative analysis path, shortcomings of this approach brought us to explore an alternative, involving data review and coding by transnational coding sub-teams. This approach was better able to illuminate cultural nuances, address coding discrepancies, and bring forward discussions to enhance interpretation and validity of findings. We describe our collaborative and iterative approach, and highlight methodological implications around team composition, language nuances and translation challenges, our coding process involving transnational coding sub-teams, and important considerations for managing team dynamics (e.g., power and hierarchy) and the partnership process and engagement over time. Moreover, we highlight the benefits of integrating insiders and outsiders throughout the research process, from data collection to coding and interpretation. Our process can serve as a model for similar transnational teams seeking ways to fully benefit from cross-cultural research collaborations.",
