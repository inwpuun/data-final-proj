All Rights Reserved.Thailand was the fi rst country outside of China where a case of COVID-19 was found when a tourist entered the country from China in February 2020. Still, as of now, the overall mortality there from Covid-19 remains much lower than in most other countries. What are the factors of this success? In this paper, we focus on the role of volunteerism and argue that its seamless integration into the Thai public health care system is founded upon the predominantly Buddhist religious culture in the country and corresponds to the cultivation of Buddhist virtues, such as compassion (karuṇā), and the motivation to do/make merit (tham bun). We suggest that Buddhist ethics and its habituation constitutes the key factor that underlies the coun try\u2019s strong volunteer culture. We address our topic by surveying the existing literature and conducting semi-structured interviews with seven health volunteers in May and June 2022. We deal with the possible objection that Theravāda Buddhism practised in Thailand is an individualistic religion and a rather negative motivating factor for volunteerism and effi cient pandemic response.",

                        "ref-fulltext": "14 There is a long and complex discussion of whether Buddhism in general and Theravada, in particular, is individualistic. The older, widely influential view of Max Weber (1864-1920) of Buddhism as individualistic is rarely accepted without qualification by today\u2019s experts. However, the precise nature of Buddhist ethics as related to Western concepts is debated. Influential scholars, such as Damien Keown (The Nature of Buddhist Ethics (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 1992); Buddhist Ethics: A Very Short Introduction. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005)), argue for affinity with Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics. This would make Buddhist ethics deeply socially relevant. Others even go further: for instance, Peter Harvey, in his An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), reports \u2018a number of Buddhist writers, primarily Theravadins, [who] have sought to articulate a \u201cBuddhist economics\u201d that is different from the capitalist or Marxist-influenced economics that have been the dominant influence on most Asian governments in the post-war era. A stimulus to many of these efforts was a short article on \u201cBuddhist Economics\u201d by the Catholic writer E. F. Schumacher, an advocate of intermediate technology and critic of Western development models who had been an economic adviser in Burma.\u2019 (pp. 215-225) The efforts of these writers, many of them Thais, such as Buddhadasa (1906-1993), Prayudh Payutto (1938-), and Sulak Sivaraksa (1933-), may be viewed as an attempt to go beyond Western individualism. However, this still does not make Theravada\u2019s religious communitiesas explicitly socially engaged as Mahayana\u2019s or other religious communities. In the latest and most sophisticated stage of the discussion, it has been argued by Donna Lynn Brown (\u2018Is Buddhism Individualistic?

        "dc:description": "Thailand was the fi rst country outside of China where a case of COVID-19 was found when a tourist entered the country from China in February 2020. Still, as of now, the overall mortality there from Covid-19 remains much lower than in most other countries. What are the factors of this success? In this paper, we focus on the role of volunteerism and argue that its seamless integration into the Thai public health care system is founded upon the predominantly Buddhist religious culture in the country and corresponds to the cultivation of Buddhist virtues, such as compassion (karuṇā), and the motivation to do/make merit (tham bun). We suggest that Buddhist ethics and its habituation constitutes the key factor that underlies the coun try\u2019s strong volunteer culture. We address our topic by surveying the existing literature and conducting semi-structured interviews with seven health volunteers in May and June 2022. We deal with the possible objection that Theravāda Buddhism practised in Thailand is an individualistic religion and a rather negative motivating factor for volunteerism and effi cient pandemic response.",
