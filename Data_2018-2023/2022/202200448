                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Increased prevalence of depression highlights the need for effective interventions. Behavioral activation (BA), which can easily be adapted for non-clinical populations, has been the recommended treatment for depression. It is based on a model of psychopathology explaining that losses or chronically low levels of positive reinforcement yield behavioral and emotional changes in depression and that encouraging individuals to increase their engagement in reinforcing activities can improve their mood and enhance their valuable life experiences. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides indices of autonomic function related to depression, but only a few studies have investigated the effect of BA on HRV, particularly among older adults with subthreshold depression. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the effect of BA on HRV in older adults with subthreshold depression. Methods: We conducted a 9-month cluster randomized controlled trial in two Health Promoting Hospitals (HPHs). Eighty-two participants were randomized into either intervention (BA with usual care) or control (usual care only) groups, with 41 participants per group. Daily step count was collected weekly during the 12-week BA intervention period, while HRV parameters, including the Standard Deviation of the Normal-to-Normal interval (SDNN), High Frequency (lnHF), Low Frequency (LF), and Low Frequency/High Frequency ratio (LF/HF), were examined at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) were used in the data analysis. Results: Over nine months, the intervention and control groups differed significantly in the unadjusted mean change of HRV, SDNN [7.59 ms (95% CI: 1.67, 13.50)], lnHF [0.44 ms2 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.85)], and LF [0.53 ms2 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.98)], whereas the groups did not differ significantly in LF/HF ratio [0.01 ms2 (95% CI: -0.04, 0.06)]. Conclusion: Our results suggest that BA may have a therapeutic effect on depression symptoms of older adults with subthreshold depression via improved HRV.

        "dc:description": "Background: Increased prevalence of depression highlights the need for effective interventions. Behavioral activation (BA), which can easily be adapted for non-clinical populations, has been the recommended treatment for depression. It is based on a model of psychopathology explaining that losses or chronically low levels of positive reinforcement yield behavioral and emotional changes in depression and that encouraging individuals to increase their engagement in reinforcing activities can improve their mood and enhance their valuable life experiences. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides indices of autonomic function related to depression, but only a few studies have investigated the effect of BA on HRV, particularly among older adults with subthreshold depression. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the effect of BA on HRV in older adults with subthreshold depression. Methods: We conducted a 9-month cluster randomized controlled trial in two Health Promoting Hospitals (HPHs). Eighty-two participants were randomized into either intervention (BA with usual care) or control (usual care only) groups, with 41 participants per group. Daily step count was collected weekly during the 12-week BA intervention period, while HRV parameters, including the Standard Deviation of the Normal-to-Normal interval (SDNN), High Frequency (lnHF), Low Frequency (LF), and Low Frequency/High Frequency ratio (LF/HF), were examined at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) were used in the data analysis. Results: Over nine months, the intervention and control groups differed significantly in the unadjusted mean change of HRV, SDNN [7.59 ms (95% CI: 1.67, 13.50)], lnHF [0.44 ms2 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.85)], and LF [0.53 ms2 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.98)], whereas the groups did not differ significantly in LF/HF ratio [0.01 ms2 (95% CI: -0.04, 0.06)]. Conclusion: Our results suggest that BA may have a therapeutic effect on depression symptoms of older adults with subthreshold depression via improved HRV.
