                "abstracts": "© 2022 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.The aim of this study was to optimise the ovarian responses using different FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) treatments in goats. Group 1 (control), the ovaries were stimulated with a total dose of 200 mg FSH per doe. The FSH injections were performed at 12-h intervals starting on day 9 after progesterone implantation. The FSH doses were decreased to 160 mg/doe and 130 mg/doe for Groups 2 and 3, respectively. The numbers of small, medium and large follicles were determined by real-time B mode ultrasonography. Ovum pick-up (OPU) was performed by laparoscopy under general anesthesia at 96, 42 and 36 h after the initial dose of FSH for Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The numbers of recovered cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) and their quality were examined. The COCs were further matured and fertilised in vitro. It was found that the numbers of small- and medium-sizes follicles in Group 2 and 3 were significantly higher than those in Group 1, whereas the numbers of large follicles in Group 1 were significantly higher than those in the other groups (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in oocyte recovery rates and the quality of COCs among groups (p > 0.05). However, the low-dose FSH (Group 3) tended to enhance oocyte recovery rates and oocyte quality compared to Group 1 (p = 0.07 and 0.06, respectively). Although the meiotic competence of recovered oocytes from Group 3 was similar to that of Group 1, cleavage rates were significantly greater than those in Group 1 (52.30 vs. 30.15%, respectively). In conclusion, ovarian stimulation with a low dose of FSH, related to the interval time between the first FSH injection and the OPU, improved oocyte recovery rates and the developmental competence of goat oocytes.",

        "dc:description": "The aim of this study was to optimise the ovarian responses using different FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) treatments in goats. Group 1 (control), the ovaries were stimulated with a total dose of 200 mg FSH per doe. The FSH injections were performed at 12-h intervals starting on day 9 after progesterone implantation. The FSH doses were decreased to 160 mg/doe and 130 mg/doe for Groups 2 and 3, respectively. The numbers of small, medium and large follicles were determined by real-time B mode ultrasonography. Ovum pick-up (OPU) was performed by laparoscopy under general anesthesia at 96, 42 and 36 h after the initial dose of FSH for Group 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The numbers of recovered cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) and their quality were examined. The COCs were further matured and fertilised in vitro. It was found that the numbers of small- and medium-sizes follicles in Group 2 and 3 were significantly higher than those in Group 1, whereas the numbers of large follicles in Group 1 were significantly higher than those in the other groups (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in oocyte recovery rates and the quality of COCs among groups (p > 0.05). However, the low-dose FSH (Group 3) tended to enhance oocyte recovery rates and oocyte quality compared to Group 1 (p = 0.07 and 0.06, respectively). Although the meiotic competence of recovered oocytes from Group 3 was similar to that of Group 1, cleavage rates were significantly greater than those in Group 1 (52.30 vs. 30.15%, respectively). In conclusion, ovarian stimulation with a low dose of FSH, related to the interval time between the first FSH injection and the OPU, improved oocyte recovery rates and the developmental competence of goat oocytes.",
