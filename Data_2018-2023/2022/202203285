                "abstracts": "© 2022 Chulalongkorn University - Faculty of Architecture. All right reserved.This article examines changes along Phra Athit Road in Rattanakosin's historic center. With the support of the state, a former commercial street became a \"cultural quarter\" and eventually a \"cultural-creative cluster,\" with creative activities infiltrating the neighborhoods. For this study, the researcher conducted a field survey and interviewed creative entrepreneurs in four sub-districts. The Phra Athit Road social and cultural resources reflect the qualities or potential resources of traditional neighbourhoods that have fostered the development of creative clusters. \"Urban culture\u201d is one of the district's key cultural resources that is properly understood and utilized, and its complex network of creative people is a crucial social resource. These creative people are \u201coutsiders\u201d with strong relationships to \u201cinsiders\u201d; some of them advocate a new way of living, while others comprise groups of intellectuals with creative economy talents and tasks. Cultural-creative clusters comprise more than people; they are typified by cafés and bars, exhibition spaces, and the production of creative products. These clusters may vary from one another in function and location, and newer clusters, less dense than the original, are less harmful to traditional communities and businesses. What they have in common is that they have enabled participants to gain real-life experiences and join distinctive activities customized by entrepreneurs. Still, those who use external resources to create goods and develop a creative cluster may endanger the very neighbourhoods where they take root. The Phra Athit Road area provides a deep understanding of \"creative clustering,\" which refers to a dynamic process that has taken place in some traditional neighbourhoods, based on the positive exploitation of their rich traditional, artistic, and cultural resources. Entrepreneurs are producing unique products that fit into complex systems, which is good for the area, but may also disrupt established patterns in the community. Transforming the historic area gradually could help locals adjust to the change. This study proposes the following approaches to promote both the protection of traditional structures and the acceptance of change: (1) The design or planning of the area should allow for development that is consistent with the rhythm of life in the area. Proper pacing of changes and the growth of well-sized creative clusters create an ecosystem that is good for both the residents and creative entrepreneurs. (2) The neighbourhood\u2019s values should be enhanced by integrating local and external resources. The wide range of creative production and consumption activities that are created from these resources will be unique and endlessly adaptable. (3) The adaptability of cultural-creative clusters should be optimized through programs provide good services and offer support to the urban regeneration. However, such programs and support should not limit the creativity and flexibility of these clusters.",

        "dc:description": "This article examines changes along Phra Athit Road in Rattanakosin's historic center. With the support of the state, a former commercial street became a \"cultural quarter\" and eventually a \"cultural-creative cluster,\" with creative activities infiltrating the neighborhoods. For this study, the researcher conducted a field survey and interviewed creative entrepreneurs in four sub-districts. The Phra Athit Road social and cultural resources reflect the qualities or potential resources of traditional neighbourhoods that have fostered the development of creative clusters. \"Urban culture\u201d is one of the district's key cultural resources that is properly understood and utilized, and its complex network of creative people is a crucial social resource. These creative people are \u201coutsiders\u201d with strong relationships to \u201cinsiders\u201d; some of them advocate a new way of living, while others comprise groups of intellectuals with creative economy talents and tasks. Cultural-creative clusters comprise more than people; they are typified by cafés and bars, exhibition spaces, and the production of creative products. These clusters may vary from one another in function and location, and newer clusters, less dense than the original, are less harmful to traditional communities and businesses. What they have in common is that they have enabled participants to gain real-life experiences and join distinctive activities customized by entrepreneurs. Still, those who use external resources to create goods and develop a creative cluster may endanger the very neighbourhoods where they take root. The Phra Athit Road area provides a deep understanding of \"creative clustering,\" which refers to a dynamic process that has taken place in some traditional neighbourhoods, based on the positive exploitation of their rich traditional, artistic, and cultural resources. Entrepreneurs are producing unique products that fit into complex systems, which is good for the area, but may also disrupt established patterns in the community. Transforming the historic area gradually could help locals adjust to the change. This study proposes the following approaches to promote both the protection of traditional structures and the acceptance of change: (1) The design or planning of the area should allow for development that is consistent with the rhythm of life in the area. Proper pacing of changes and the growth of well-sized creative clusters create an ecosystem that is good for both the residents and creative entrepreneurs. (2) The neighbourhood\u2019s values should be enhanced by integrating local and external resources. The wide range of creative production and consumption activities that are created from these resources will be unique and endlessly adaptable. (3) The adaptability of cultural-creative clusters should be optimized through programs provide good services and offer support to the urban regeneration. However, such programs and support should not limit the creativity and flexibility of these clusters.",
