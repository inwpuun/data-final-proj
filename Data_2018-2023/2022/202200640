                "abstracts": "© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Marek's disease (MD) is a highly contagious lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2, commonly known as serotype 1 Marek's disease virus (MDV-1). Despite widespread vaccination, MD-related cases have been frequently observed worldwide, including in Thailand. However, no information is available on the genetic characteristics of MDV-1 field strains circulating in chickens in Thailand. This study investigated the geographic distribution and genetic characteristics of MDV-1 field strains circulating in chickens in Thailand between 2013 and 2021 by analysing the Meq and pp38 genes. Out of a total of the 286 clinical samples obtained from 70 chicken farms located in major chicken raising areas of Thailand, 138 samples (48.25%) from 46 chicken farms (65.71%) tested positive for MDV-1 field strains. Results demonstrated that MDV-1 field strains were extensively distributed in major chicken raising areas. Phylogenetic analyses based on the Meq gene revealed that four clusters of MDV-1 circulated in chickens in Thailand between 2013 and 2021. Among these clusters, cluster 1 was the predominant cluster circulating in chickens in Thailand. Additionally, our findings based on molecular characteristics of Meq and pp38 gene/protein suggested that most of the Thai MDV-1 field strains were potentially highly virulent. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the circulation of different clusters of MDV-1 with virulence characteristics in chickens in Thailand, indicating high genetic diversity of MDV-1 in Thailand. This study highlights the importance of more effective vaccine development and routine MDV-1 surveillance for early detection and control of highly virulent MDV-1.",

        "dc:description": "Marek's disease (MD) is a highly contagious lymphoproliferative disease of chickens caused by Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2, commonly known as serotype 1 Marek's disease virus (MDV-1). Despite widespread vaccination, MD-related cases have been frequently observed worldwide, including in Thailand. However, no information is available on the genetic characteristics of MDV-1 field strains circulating in chickens in Thailand. This study investigated the geographic distribution and genetic characteristics of MDV-1 field strains circulating in chickens in Thailand between 2013 and 2021 by analysing the Meq and pp38 genes. Out of a total of the 286 clinical samples obtained from 70 chicken farms located in major chicken raising areas of Thailand, 138 samples (48.25%) from 46 chicken farms (65.71%) tested positive for MDV-1 field strains. Results demonstrated that MDV-1 field strains were extensively distributed in major chicken raising areas. Phylogenetic analyses based on the Meq gene revealed that four clusters of MDV-1 circulated in chickens in Thailand between 2013 and 2021. Among these clusters, cluster 1 was the predominant cluster circulating in chickens in Thailand. Additionally, our findings based on molecular characteristics of Meq and pp38 gene/protein suggested that most of the Thai MDV-1 field strains were potentially highly virulent. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the circulation of different clusters of MDV-1 with virulence characteristics in chickens in Thailand, indicating high genetic diversity of MDV-1 in Thailand. This study highlights the importance of more effective vaccine development and routine MDV-1 surveillance for early detection and control of highly virulent MDV-1.",
