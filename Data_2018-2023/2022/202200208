                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s).The body of knowledge regarding the classification and evolution of freshwater mussels in the family Unionidae (Bivalvia) in Indochina has recently increased. However, the taxonomic revision of all extant taxa in the region is still ongoing. In this study, the genus Pilsbryoconcha was revised based on an integrative analysis of shell morphology, biogeography, and molecular data. Multi-locus phylogeny indicated the availability of eight species within the genus. Four previously recognized species are P. exilis (Lea, 1838), P. schomburgki (Martens, 1860) stat. rev., P. linguaeformis (Morelet, 1875), and P. carinifera (Conrad, 1837), while four other species are described herein as P. acuta sp. nov., P. mekongiana sp. nov., P. kittitati sp. nov., and P. hoikaab sp. nov. In addition, the neotype of P. carinifera is also designated to clarify its long taxonomic ambiguity. Divergent time estimation and historical biogeography analysis revealed that Pilsbryoconcha originated in the area now called the Khorat Plateau around the middle of the Eocene (mean age = 43.12 Mya), before its range was expanded across Indochina through a series of complex geomorphological changes of river systems, which also led to diversification of the genus.",

        "dc:description": "The body of knowledge regarding the classification and evolution of freshwater mussels in the family Unionidae (Bivalvia) in Indochina has recently increased. However, the taxonomic revision of all extant taxa in the region is still ongoing. In this study, the genus Pilsbryoconcha was revised based on an integrative analysis of shell morphology, biogeography, and molecular data. Multi-locus phylogeny indicated the availability of eight species within the genus. Four previously recognized species are P. exilis (Lea, 1838), P. schomburgki (Martens, 1860) stat. rev., P. linguaeformis (Morelet, 1875), and P. carinifera (Conrad, 1837), while four other species are described herein as P. acuta sp. nov., P. mekongiana sp. nov., P. kittitati sp. nov., and P. hoikaab sp. nov. In addition, the neotype of P. carinifera is also designated to clarify its long taxonomic ambiguity. Divergent time estimation and historical biogeography analysis revealed that Pilsbryoconcha originated in the area now called the Khorat Plateau around the middle of the Eocene (mean age = 43.12 Mya), before its range was expanded across Indochina through a series of complex geomorphological changes of river systems, which also led to diversification of the genus.",
