                "abstracts": "© 2022 Elsevier Inc.Background: Turnover is an important issue in all healthcare professions including pharmacy practice settings. A high turnover rate of pharmacists, not only has negative financial impact, but also reduces quality of care and patient safety. The high turnover also increases workload and job stress which can increase job errors and decrease job efficiency and performance in pharmacy practices. Objectives: To systematically review the extent of pharmacists' turnover and their intention to leave their jobs or the pharmacy profession. Methods: An electronic search was performed from database inception to December 19, 2020 using the following 6 databases; PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, ERIC, and ERIC-EBSCO. Articles were included if they were relevant to reports of pharmacist turnover or turnover intention. Only research studies were included, but not editorials, letters, or review articles. Results: Twenty-eight studies were contained within this systematic review. Using the QualSyst assessment tool to assess the included article qualities, all studies demonstrated good quality with quality assessment score of 0.75. Fifteen studies (53.6%) were conducted from the US, 3 studies (10.7%) from Taiwan, 2 studies (7.1%) from the UK, and the remaining studies from Lithuania, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Jamaica. The turnover of the pharmacists from their jobs ranged from 8.6 to 17%, and the turnover from the pharmacy profession was in the range of 6\u20139%. The turnover intention of the pharmacists in their jobs was from 13% to 61.2%, and the turnover intention in the pharmacy profession was 6.5%\u201318.8%. Hospital pharmacists had significantly higher turnover intentions than community ones. The turnover intention rates of both hospital and community pharmacists have gradually increased over time in both European countries and Asian countries. Conclusion: Based on the included articles, pharmacists' turnover rate appeared to increase over time. However, based on the heterogeneity of studies, further research is warranted to confirm this and to help to identify the potential causes of turnover intention since intention was related to behavior.",

A high turnover rate of pharmacists, not only has negative financial impact, but also reduces quality of care and patient safety. The high turnover also increases workload and job stress which can increase job errors and decrease job efficiency and performance in pharmacy practices. Objectives: To systematically review the extent of pharmacists' turnover and their intention to leave their jobs or the pharmacy profession. Methods: An electronic search was performed from database inception to December 19, 2020 using the following 6 databases; PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, ERIC, and ERIC-EBSCO. Articles were included if they were relevant to reports of pharmacist turnover or turnover intention. Only research studies were included, but not editorials, letters, or review articles. Results: Twenty-eight studies were contained within this systematic review. Using the QualSyst assessment tool to assess the included article qualities, all studies demonstrated good quality with quality assessment score of 0.75. Fifteen studies (53.6%) were conducted from the US, 3 studies (10.7%) from Taiwan, 2 studies (7.1%) from the UK, and the remaining studies from Lithuania, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Jamaica. The turnover of the pharmacists from their jobs ranged from 8.6 to 17%, and the turnover from the pharmacy profession was in the range of 6\u20139%. The turnover intention of the pharmacists in their jobs was from 13% to 61.2%, and the turnover intention in the pharmacy profession was 6.5%\u201318.8%. Hospital pharmacists had significantly higher turnover intentions than community ones. The turnover intention rates of both hospital and community pharmacists have gradually increased over time in both European countries and Asian countries. Conclusion: Based on the included articles, pharmacists' turnover rate appeared to increase over time. However, based on the heterogeneity of studies, further research is warranted to confirm this and to help to identify the potential causes of turnover intention since intention was related to behavior.",
