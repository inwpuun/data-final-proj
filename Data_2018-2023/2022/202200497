A total of 454 E. coli isolates from healthy pigs (n = 354; piglets, n = 83; fattening pigs, n = 142 and sows, n = 100) and sick pigs (n = 100) were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility, chromosomal and plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanisms and ESBL genes. The healthy (41%) and sick pig (73%) isolates were commonly resistant to colistin. Three mcr genes including mcr-1 (10.4%), mcr-2 (1.1%) and mcr-3 (45%) were detected, of which mcr-3 was most frequently detected in the healthy (33%) and sick pig (57%) isolates. Coexistence of mcr-1/mcr-3 and mcr-2/mcr-3 was observed in piglets (23%), fattening pig (3.5%) and sick pig (13%) isolates. Three amino acid substitutions including E106A and G144S in PmrA and V161G in PmrB were observed only in colistin-resistant isolates carrying mcr-3. The percentage of ESBL-producing E. coli was significantly higher in the sick pigs (44%) than the healthy pigs (19.2%) (P = 0.00). The blaCTX-M group was most prevalent (98.5%), of which blaCTX-M-14 (54.5%) and blaCTX-M-55 (42.9%) were predominant. The blaTEM-1 (68.8%) and blaCMY-2 (6.3%) genes were identified in ESBL-producers. All ESBL producers were multidrug resistant and the majority from piglets (97%), fattening pigs (77.3%) and sick pigs (82%) carried mcr gene (s). ESBL producers from piglets (n = 5) and sick pig (n = 1) simultaneously transferred blaTEM-1 (or blaCTX-M-55) and mcr-3 to Salmonella. In conclusion, pigs are important reservoirs of colistin-resistant E. coli that also produced ESBLs, highlighting the need for prudent and effective use of antimicrobials in pigs and other food-producing animals.",

        "dc:description": "This study aimed to determine the percentage of colistin resistant and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli from clinically sick and healthy pigs and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying colistin resistance and ESBL production. A total of 454 E. coli isolates from healthy pigs (n = 354; piglets, n = 83; fattening pigs, n = 142 and sows, n = 100) and sick pigs (n = 100) were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility, chromosomal and plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanisms and ESBL genes. The healthy (41%) and sick pig (73%) isolates were commonly resistant to colistin. Three mcr genes including mcr-1 (10.4%), mcr-2 (1.1%) and mcr-3 (45%) were detected, of which mcr-3 was most frequently detected in the healthy (33%) and sick pig (57%) isolates. Coexistence of mcr-1/mcr-3 and mcr-2/mcr-3 was observed in piglets (23%), fattening pig (3.5%) and sick pig (13%) isolates. Three amino acid substitutions including E106A and G144S in PmrA and V161G in PmrB were observed only in colistin-resistant isolates carrying mcr-3. The percentage of ESBL-producing E. coli was significantly higher in the sick pigs (44%) than the healthy pigs (19.2%) (P = 0.00). The blaCTX-M group was most prevalent (98.5%), of which blaCTX-M-14 (54.5%) and blaCTX-M-55 (42.9%) were predominant. The blaTEM-1 (68.8%) and blaCMY-2 (6.3%) genes were identified in ESBL-producers. All ESBL producers were multidrug resistant and the majority from piglets (97%), fattening pigs (77.3%) and sick pigs (82%) carried mcr gene (s). ESBL producers from piglets (n = 5) and sick pig (n = 1) simultaneously transferred blaTEM-1 (or blaCTX-M-55) and mcr-3 to Salmonella. In conclusion, pigs are important reservoirs of colistin-resistant E. coli that also produced ESBLs, highlighting the need for prudent and effective use of antimicrobials in pigs and other food-producing animals.",
