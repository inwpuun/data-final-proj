                "abstracts": "© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The popularization of electronic clinical medical records makes it possible to use automated methods to extract high-value information from medical records quickly. As essential medical information, oncology medical events are composed of attributes that describe malignant tumors. In recent years, oncology medicine event extraction has become a research hotspot in academia. Many academic conferences publish it as an evaluation task and provide a series of high-quality annotation data. This article aims at the characteristics of discrete attributes of tumor-related medical events and proposes a medical event. The standard extraction method realizes the combined extraction of the primary tumor site and primary tumor size characteristics, as well as the extraction of tumor metastasis sites. In addition, given the problems of the small number and types of annotation texts for tumor-related medical events, a key-based approach is proposed. A pseudo-data-generation algorithm that randomly replaces information in the whole domain improves the transfer learning ability of the standard extraction method for different types of tumor-related medical event extractions. The proposed method won third place in the clinical medical event extraction and evaluation task of the CCKS2020 electronic medical record. A large number of experiments on the CCKS2020 dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "dc:description": "The popularization of electronic clinical medical records makes it possible to use automated methods to extract high-value information from medical records quickly. As essential medical information, oncology medical events are composed of attributes that describe malignant tumors. In recent years, oncology medicine event extraction has become a research hotspot in academia. Many academic conferences publish it as an evaluation task and provide a series of high-quality annotation data. This article aims at the characteristics of discrete attributes of tumor-related medical events and proposes a medical event. The standard extraction method realizes the combined extraction of the primary tumor site and primary tumor size characteristics, as well as the extraction of tumor metastasis sites. In addition, given the problems of the small number and types of annotation texts for tumor-related medical events, a key-based approach is proposed. A pseudo-data-generation algorithm that randomly replaces information in the whole domain improves the transfer learning ability of the standard extraction method for different types of tumor-related medical event extractions. The proposed method won third place in the clinical medical event extraction and evaluation task of the CCKS2020 electronic medical record. A large number of experiments on the CCKS2020 dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
