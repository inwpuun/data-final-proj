                "abstracts": "© 2022 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.Background and Aim: Feline platynosomiasis, also known as lizard poisoning, is a feline hepatic disease caused by the parasitic trematode Platynosomum fastosum. Since this helminth resides in biliary ducts and gallbladder, the heavy infection can lead to failure of the hepatobiliary system and can be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The primary diagnostic tool currently used is conventional fecal microscopy. However, low sensitivity of detection could occur in the case of light infection or biliary obstruction. This study aimed to determine the antibody-specific pattern of P. fastosum crude antigen and to identify immunoreactive proteins to develop the immunodiagnostic techniques. Materials and Methods: We investigated potential antigens specific to P. fastosum infection using western blotting. Forty-six samples of cat serum, including 16 P. fastosum-infected sera, eight healthy control sera, and 22 sera infected with other endoparasites were used. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each band were calculated. Immunoreactive bands with high diagnostic values were further analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the protein components. Results: Using immunoblotting, three proteins of 72 kDa, 53 kDa, and 13 kDa were found to be immunogenic. LC-MS/MS identified these proteins as a 70 kDa heat shock protein, a hypothetical protein (CRM22_002083) (adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit beta), and histone H2B, respectively. Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal three proteins that could be candidates for developing diagnostic tools for feline platynosomiasis.",

        "dc:description": "Background and Aim: Feline platynosomiasis, also known as lizard poisoning, is a feline hepatic disease caused by the parasitic trematode Platynosomum fastosum. Since this helminth resides in biliary ducts and gallbladder, the heavy infection can lead to failure of the hepatobiliary system and can be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The primary diagnostic tool currently used is conventional fecal microscopy. However, low sensitivity of detection could occur in the case of light infection or biliary obstruction. This study aimed to determine the antibody-specific pattern of P. fastosum crude antigen and to identify immunoreactive proteins to develop the immunodiagnostic techniques. Materials and Methods: We investigated potential antigens specific to P. fastosum infection using western blotting. Forty-six samples of cat serum, including 16 P. fastosum-infected sera, eight healthy control sera, and 22 sera infected with other endoparasites were used. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of each band were calculated. Immunoreactive bands with high diagnostic values were further analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the protein components. Results: Using immunoblotting, three proteins of 72 kDa, 53 kDa, and 13 kDa were found to be immunogenic. LC-MS/MS identified these proteins as a 70 kDa heat shock protein, a hypothetical protein (CRM22_002083) (adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit beta), and histone H2B, respectively. Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal three proteins that could be candidates for developing diagnostic tools for feline platynosomiasis.",
