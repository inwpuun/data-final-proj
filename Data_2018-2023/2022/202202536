                "abstracts": "© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Objective: The present study evaluated the efficacy of three different supplementary cleaning protocols on the removal of bioceramic-based root canal filling materials from oval-shaped canals. Materials and methods: A total of 36 human mandibular premolars were instrumented and obturated with gutta-percha and iRoot SP using the single-cone technique. Retreatment was performed with ProTaper Universal retreatment files. The samples were randomly divided into the following supplementary cleaning protocols: conventional syringe irrigation (CSI), passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), and XP-endo Finisher R (XPR). The samples underwent micro-CT scanning to quantify the amount of residual filling materials after retreatment and after performing the cleaning protocols. The volume of filling material removal was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni and Games\u2013Howell tests (P < 0.05). Results: There were significant differences in the amount of root canal filling material removal in every comparison group (P < 0.05). The XPR removed significantly more residual filling materials (P < 0.01) followed by PUI and CSI (P < 0.05). Similar efficacy was found in the total root canal and all root thirds. Conclusions: The additional use of XP-endo Finisher R and passive ultrasonic irrigation effectively removed the bioceramic-obturated root filling materials from the oval-shaped canals. However, none of the techniques completely removed the filling materials. Clinical relevance: The XP-endo Finisher R and passive ultrasonic irrigation exhibited greater efficacy compared with syringe irrigation in the reduction of residual filling materials after retreatment in root-filled teeth with a bioceramic sealer.",

        "dc:description": "Objective: The present study evaluated the efficacy of three different supplementary cleaning protocols on the removal of bioceramic-based root canal filling materials from oval-shaped canals. Materials and methods: A total of 36 human mandibular premolars were instrumented and obturated with gutta-percha and iRoot SP using the single-cone technique. Retreatment was performed with ProTaper Universal retreatment files. The samples were randomly divided into the following supplementary cleaning protocols: conventional syringe irrigation (CSI), passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), and XP-endo Finisher R (XPR). The samples underwent micro-CT scanning to quantify the amount of residual filling materials after retreatment and after performing the cleaning protocols. The volume of filling material removal was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni and Games\u2013Howell tests (P < 0.05). Results: There were significant differences in the amount of root canal filling material removal in every comparison group (P < 0.05). The XPR removed significantly more residual filling materials (P < 0.01) followed by PUI and CSI (P < 0.05). Similar efficacy was found in the total root canal and all root thirds. Conclusions: The additional use of XP-endo Finisher R and passive ultrasonic irrigation effectively removed the bioceramic-obturated root filling materials from the oval-shaped canals. However, none of the techniques completely removed the filling materials. Clinical relevance: The XP-endo Finisher R and passive ultrasonic irrigation exhibited greater efficacy compared with syringe irrigation in the reduction of residual filling materials after retreatment in root-filled teeth with a bioceramic sealer.",
