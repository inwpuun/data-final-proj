                "abstracts": "© 2022 Jean-Lon Chen et al.Objectives. The texture of the autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) that is used in treating degenerative joint diseases such as knee osteoarthritis (OA) is usually in liquid form. However, the turnover rate of protein metabolism in the knee synovial fluid (SF) is less than one hour. This study examined the feasibility of the thermal oscillation technique in converting the liquid-form PRP into an injectable viscous paste-like PRP that may delay the degradation of PRP and continuously release growth factors in the knee joint for a longer period of time. Methods. This study was conducted in the rehabilitation department of a tertiary hospital. A total of 10 elderly patients with an average age of greater than 65 years and diagnosed with moderate degree of knee OA were recruited. The RegenPRP (RegenLab, Le Mont-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland) test tube chamber was used for PRP generation. A total of 60 milliliters (mL) of blood was drawn from each patient. 10 mL of blood was injected into each PRP test tube chamber. As a result, a total of 6 test tube chambers were obtained and each chamber was centrifuged for 15 minutes. Approximately 5 mL of PRP supernatant (the liquid-form end product) was aspirated and sent for thermal oscillation treatment. Five temperatures were tested: 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95 degrees Celsius. Oscillation was set at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 15 minutes. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied in measuring the concentration of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in picogram/milliliter (pg/mL). Repeated measures ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare the PDGF concentrations between each testing condition. Results. Under 75 degrees Celsius of heating, the resultant paste-like PRP end product had the highest concentration of PDGF in picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) as compared with other heating conditions (p<0.05). The viscosity of the paste-like PRP was measured to be 70,000 centipoise (cP), which is similar to the viscosity of a toothpaste. The paste-like PRP end product was able to release PDGF continuously for about 14 days, with the highest concentration achieved on the 8th day with an average of 35646±2499 pg/mL. In nonthermally treated liquid-form PRP sample, the highest number of PRP was observed on the 4th day with an average value of 8444±831 pg/mL. Under the heating conditions of 55 and 95 degrees Celsius, the highest concentration of PDGF was observed on the 5th day (13346±764 pg/mL and 3440±303 pg/mL, respectively). Under the heating conditions of 65 and 85 degrees Celsius, the highest concentration of PDGF was observed on the 7th day (15468±744 pg/mL and 20432±1118 pg/mL, respectively). Conclusion. Through thermal oscillation, liquid-form PRP can be converted to paste-like PRP end product with a viscosity similar to that of a toothpaste. The best heating condition was discovered to be 75 degrees Celsius. The paste-like PRP was able to release PDGF continuously for about 2 weeks, with the highest concentration obtained on the 8th day. The findings in this study suggested that paste-like PRP may be a viable option in treating degenerative knee joint diseases.",

        "dc:description": "Objectives. The texture of the autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) that is used in treating degenerative joint diseases such as knee osteoarthritis (OA) is usually in liquid form. However, the turnover rate of protein metabolism in the knee synovial fluid (SF) is less than one hour. This study examined the feasibility of the thermal oscillation technique in converting the liquid-form PRP into an injectable viscous paste-like PRP that may delay the degradation of PRP and continuously release growth factors in the knee joint for a longer period of time. Methods. This study was conducted in the rehabilitation department of a tertiary hospital. A total of 10 elderly patients with an average age of greater than 65 years and diagnosed with moderate degree of knee OA were recruited. The RegenPRP (RegenLab, Le Mont-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland) test tube chamber was used for PRP generation. A total of 60 milliliters (mL) of blood was drawn from each patient. 10 mL of blood was injected into each PRP test tube chamber. As a result, a total of 6 test tube chambers were obtained and each chamber was centrifuged for 15 minutes. Approximately 5 mL of PRP supernatant (the liquid-form end product) was aspirated and sent for thermal oscillation treatment. Five temperatures were tested: 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95 degrees Celsius. Oscillation was set at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 15 minutes. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied in measuring the concentration of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in picogram/milliliter (pg/mL). Repeated measures ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare the PDGF concentrations between each testing condition. Results. Under 75 degrees Celsius of heating, the resultant paste-like PRP end product had the highest concentration of PDGF in picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) as compared with other heating conditions (p<0.05). The viscosity of the paste-like PRP was measured to be 70,000 centipoise (cP), which is similar to the viscosity of a toothpaste. The paste-like PRP end product was able to release PDGF continuously for about 14 days, with the highest concentration achieved on the 8th day with an average of 35646±2499 pg/mL. In nonthermally treated liquid-form PRP sample, the highest number of PRP was observed on the 4th day with an average value of 8444±831 pg/mL. Under the heating conditions of 55 and 95 degrees Celsius, the highest concentration of PDGF was observed on the 5th day (13346±764 pg/mL and 3440±303 pg/mL, respectively). Under the heating conditions of 65 and 85 degrees Celsius, the highest concentration of PDGF was observed on the 7th day (15468±744 pg/mL and 20432±1118 pg/mL, respectively). Conclusion. Through thermal oscillation, liquid-form PRP can be converted to paste-like PRP end product with a viscosity similar to that of a toothpaste. The best heating condition was discovered to be 75 degrees Celsius. The paste-like PRP was able to release PDGF continuously for about 2 weeks, with the highest concentration obtained on the 8th day. The findings in this study suggested that paste-like PRP may be a viable option in treating degenerative knee joint diseases.",
