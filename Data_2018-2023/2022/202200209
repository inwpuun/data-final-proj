                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s).Coastal protection measures can be categorized into grey and green solutions in terms of their ecosystem impacts. As the use of grey solutions has become a serious issue due to environmental consequences during the last few decades, green/nature-based solutions have become prioritized. This study evaluates the effectiveness of grey and green solutions applied along the eastern Chao Phraya Delta (ECPD) based on historical shoreline change analysis and coastal observations using Light Detection and Ranging technology. The results from shoreline analysis indicate that nearshore breakwaters installed 100\u2013250 m from the shoreline have successfully reclaimed the coastline with a sedimentation rate of 17\u201323 cm/y. Meanwhile, sand-sausage-submerged breakwaters were ineffective at stabilizing the coastline during 2002\u20132010 due to land subsidence. With a low subsidence rate, the rubble-mound-submerged breakwaters can reduce the shoreline retreat rate with a vertical deposition rate of about 5 cm/y. In contrast, use of a bamboo fence, a green solution widely used along muddy coasts, traps sediment at a rate of less than 1.3 cm/y and typically lasts only for 2\u20133 years after installation. Decomposed bamboo causes environmental degradation so local communities disapprove of the approach. Results reveal that grey solutions are more effective for stabilizing the ECPD coastline and result in less coastal environmental impact than the nature-based solution using a bamboo fence.",

        "dc:description": "Coastal protection measures can be categorized into grey and green solutions in terms of their ecosystem impacts. As the use of grey solutions has become a serious issue due to environmental consequences during the last few decades, green/nature-based solutions have become prioritized. This study evaluates the effectiveness of grey and green solutions applied along the eastern Chao Phraya Delta (ECPD) based on historical shoreline change analysis and coastal observations using Light Detection and Ranging technology. The results from shoreline analysis indicate that nearshore breakwaters installed 100\u2013250 m from the shoreline have successfully reclaimed the coastline with a sedimentation rate of 17\u201323 cm/y. Meanwhile, sand-sausage-submerged breakwaters were ineffective at stabilizing the coastline during 2002\u20132010 due to land subsidence. With a low subsidence rate, the rubble-mound-submerged breakwaters can reduce the shoreline retreat rate with a vertical deposition rate of about 5 cm/y. In contrast, use of a bamboo fence, a green solution widely used along muddy coasts, traps sediment at a rate of less than 1.3 cm/y and typically lasts only for 2\u20133 years after installation. Decomposed bamboo causes environmental degradation so local communities disapprove of the approach. Results reveal that grey solutions are more effective for stabilizing the ECPD coastline and result in less coastal environmental impact than the nature-based solution using a bamboo fence.",
