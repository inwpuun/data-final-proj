All rights reserved.This article examines Thailand\u2019s historic charitable trusts for the purpose of establishing and maintaining cemeteries and places of worship. Whilst existing literature explores the reception of English trusts law in British colonial territories in Southeast Asia over the course of nineteenth century, little is discussed in relation to Thailand, historically known as Siam, during the same period. Based on the author\u2019s archival research, this article explores the route and development of these trusts and argues that, due to the Thai Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of their charitable purpose, these trusts are not subject to a rule against perpetuities. Therefore, they will continue to present an anomalous exception to Thailand\u2019s civil law legal framework and offer a fascinating example of the deep, tenacious roots put down by a rejected legal concept from Thailand\u2019s brush with nineteenth century colonial powers.",

Whilst existing literature explores the reception of English trusts law in British colonial territories in Southeast Asia over the course of nineteenth century, little is discussed in relation to Thailand, historically known as Siam, during the same period. Based on the author\u2019s archival research, this article explores the route and development of these trusts and argues that, due to the Thai Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of their charitable purpose, these trusts are not subject to a rule against perpetuities. Therefore, they will continue to present an anomalous exception to Thailand\u2019s civil law legal framework and offer a fascinating example of the deep, tenacious roots put down by a rejected legal concept from Thailand\u2019s brush with nineteenth century colonial powers.",
