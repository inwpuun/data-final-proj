                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s).Biosurfactant-based dispersants were formulated by mixing glycolipids from Weissella cibaria PN3 and lipopeptides from Bacillus subtilis GY19 to enhance the synergistic effect and thereby achieve hydrophilic-lipophilic balance. The proportions of each biosurfactant and dispersant-to-oil ratios (DORs) were varied to obtain the appropriated formulations. The most efficient glycolipid:lipopeptide mixtures (F1 and F2) had oil displacement activities of 81\u201388% for fuel and crude oils. The baffled flask test of these formulations showed 77\u201379% dispersion effectiveness at a DOR of 1:25. To reduce the cost of the dispersant, this study optimized the glycolipid production process by using immobilized cells in a stirred tank fermenter. Semicontinuous glycolipid production was carried out conveniently for 3 cycles. Moreover, food wastes, including waste coconut water and waste frying oil, were found to promote glycolipid production. Glycolipids from the optimized process and substrates had similar characteristics but 20\u201350% lower cost than those produced from basal medium with soybean oil in shaking flasks. The lowest cost dispersant formulation (F2*) contained 10 g/L waste-derived cell-bound glycolipid and 10 g/L lipopeptide and showed high dispersion efficiency with various oils. Therefore, this biosurfactant-based dispersant could be produced on a larger scale for further application.",

        "dc:description": "Biosurfactant-based dispersants were formulated by mixing glycolipids from Weissella cibaria PN3 and lipopeptides from Bacillus subtilis GY19 to enhance the synergistic effect and thereby achieve hydrophilic-lipophilic balance. The proportions of each biosurfactant and dispersant-to-oil ratios (DORs) were varied to obtain the appropriated formulations. The most efficient glycolipid:lipopeptide mixtures (F1 and F2) had oil displacement activities of 81\u201388% for fuel and crude oils. The baffled flask test of these formulations showed 77\u201379% dispersion effectiveness at a DOR of 1:25. To reduce the cost of the dispersant, this study optimized the glycolipid production process by using immobilized cells in a stirred tank fermenter. Semicontinuous glycolipid production was carried out conveniently for 3 cycles. Moreover, food wastes, including waste coconut water and waste frying oil, were found to promote glycolipid production. Glycolipids from the optimized process and substrates had similar characteristics but 20\u201350% lower cost than those produced from basal medium with soybean oil in shaking flasks. The lowest cost dispersant formulation (F2*) contained 10 g/L waste-derived cell-bound glycolipid and 10 g/L lipopeptide and showed high dispersion efficiency with various oils. Therefore, this biosurfactant-based dispersant could be produced on a larger scale for further application.",
