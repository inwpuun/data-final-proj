When the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic begins in a country, its impact is disastrous to both the country and its neighbors. In early 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was associated with global aviation. More recently, COVID-19 infections due to illegal or undocumented immigration have played a significant role in spreading the disease in Southeast Asia countries. Therefore, the spread of COVID-19 of all countries\u2019 border should be curbed. Many countries closed their borders to all nations, causing an unprecedented decline in global travel, especially cross-border travel. This restriction affects social and economic trade-offs. Therefore, immigration policies are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand and simulate the spread of the disease under different immigration conditions, we developed a novel mathematical model called the Legal immigration and Undocumented immigration from natural borders for Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized and Recovered people (LUSIHR). The purpose of the model was to simulate the number of infected people under various policies, including uncontrolled, fully controlled, and partially controlled countries. The infection rate was parameterized using the collected data from the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. We demonstrated that the model possesses nonnegative solutions for favorable initial conditions. The analysis of numerical experiments showed that we could control the virus spread and maintain the number of infected people by increasing the control rate of undocumented immigration across the unprotected natural borders. Next, the obtained parameters were used to visualize the effect of the control rate on immigration at the natural border. Overall, the model was well-suited to explaining and building the simulation. The parameters were used to simulate the trends in the number of people infected from COVID-19.",

        "dc:description": "At present, a large number of people worldwide have been infected by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). When the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic begins in a country, its impact is disastrous to both the country and its neighbors. In early 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was associated with global aviation. More recently, COVID-19 infections due to illegal or undocumented immigration have played a significant role in spreading the disease in Southeast Asia countries. Therefore, the spread of COVID-19 of all countries\u2019 border should be curbed. Many countries closed their borders to all nations, causing an unprecedented decline in global travel, especially cross-border travel. This restriction affects social and economic trade-offs. Therefore, immigration policies are essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand and simulate the spread of the disease under different immigration conditions, we developed a novel mathematical model called the Legal immigration and Undocumented immigration from natural borders for Susceptible-Infected-Hospitalized and Recovered people (LUSIHR). The purpose of the model was to simulate the number of infected people under various policies, including uncontrolled, fully controlled, and partially controlled countries. The infection rate was parameterized using the collected data from the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. We demonstrated that the model possesses nonnegative solutions for favorable initial conditions. The analysis of numerical experiments showed that we could control the virus spread and maintain the number of infected people by increasing the control rate of undocumented immigration across the unprotected natural borders. Next, the obtained parameters were used to visualize the effect of the control rate on immigration at the natural border. Overall, the model was well-suited to explaining and building the simulation. The parameters were used to simulate the trends in the number of people infected from COVID-19.",
