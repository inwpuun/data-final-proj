                "abstracts": "© 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Purpose: Pterygium, a common ocular growth, has an unknown pathogenesis and aetiology. Environmental factors such as ultraviolet light, genetic factors and viral infections may be implicated in the development of pterygia. Human papillomavirus (HPV), an oncogenic virus, has previous been detected in individuals with pterygia. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HPV genotypes in pterygia from Thai individuals. Methods: DNA was extracted from 389 pterygia. HPV was detected by nested PCR and HPV genotyping was conducted using reverse hybridization. The DNA sequences of HPV-L1 genes were analyzed. Results: HPV was detected in only 6.8% (25/389) of pterygia from Thai individuals. The majority (16/25, 64%) of strains were genotyped as HPV-16 and the remainder (9/25, 36%) could not be typed. Four pterygia showed evidence of coinfection by HPV-16 and either HPV-18 (2/25, 8%) or HPV-58 (2/25, 8%). Nine of 11 samples showed the same HPV-16 L1 gene sequence that was identical to a HPV-16 reference sequence in GenBank. The remaining two samples each bore silent single nucleotide mutations (T1078G and T1081A) that did not result in amino acid changes. Conclusion: HPV, especially HPV-16, may be one of the pathogens causing pterygia in Thai individuals. Genotyping data suggested that HPV-16 from pterygia may be similar in sequence to HPV-16 causing cervical cancer.",

Environmental factors such as ultraviolet light, genetic factors and viral infections may be implicated in the development of pterygia. Human papillomavirus (HPV), an oncogenic virus, has previous been detected in individuals with pterygia. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HPV genotypes in pterygia from Thai individuals. Methods: DNA was extracted from 389 pterygia. HPV was detected by nested PCR and HPV genotyping was conducted using reverse hybridization. The DNA sequences of HPV-L1 genes were analyzed. Results: HPV was detected in only 6.8% (25/389) of pterygia from Thai individuals. The majority (16/25, 64%) of strains were genotyped as HPV-16 and the remainder (9/25, 36%) could not be typed. Four pterygia showed evidence of coinfection by HPV-16 and either HPV-18 (2/25, 8%) or HPV-58 (2/25, 8%). Nine of 11 samples showed the same HPV-16 L1 gene sequence that was identical to a HPV-16 reference sequence in GenBank. The remaining two samples each bore silent single nucleotide mutations (T1078G and T1081A) that did not result in amino acid changes. Conclusion: HPV, especially HPV-16, may be one of the pathogens causing pterygia in Thai individuals. Genotyping data suggested that HPV-16 from pterygia may be similar in sequence to HPV-16 causing cervical cancer.",
