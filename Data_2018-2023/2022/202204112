                "abstracts": "© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are capable of achieving data dissemination between them such that exploration of their potential could be performed based on their frequency range. It is considered to be highly difficult for recharging sensor devices under adverse situations. The main drawbacks of WSNs concern to the issue of network lifetime, coverage area, scheduling and data aggregation. In particular, prolonging network lifetime confirms the success together with the energy conservation of sensor nodes, data transmission reliability and scalability of their operation in data aggregation. Clustering schemes are considered to be highly suitable for effectively utilising the resources with lower overhead, such that energy consumption is enhanced for upgrading the network lifespan. In this paper, a Hybrid Modified Artificial Bee Colony and Firefly Algorithm (HMABCFA) -Based Cluster Head Selection is proposed for ensuring energy stabilisation, delay minimisation and inter-node distance reduction for improving the network lifetime. This proposed HMABCFA integrates the benefit of the Firefly optimisation algorithm for generating a new position that which has the capability of replacing the position, which is not updated in the scout bee phase of ABC. This incorporation of Firefly optimisation algorithm into the ABC algorithm prevents the limitations of premature convergence, slow convergence and the possibility of being trapped into the local point of optimality in the clustering process. The modified ABC-based clustering process is phenomenal in improving the feasible dimensions for enhancing the process of exploitation and exploration. The results of the HMABCFA, on an average are confirmed to enhance the network lifetime by 23.21%, energy stability by 19.84% and reduce network latency by 22.88%, compared to the benchmarked approaches.",

        "dc:description": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are capable of achieving data dissemination between them such that exploration of their potential could be performed based on their frequency range. It is considered to be highly difficult for recharging sensor devices under adverse situations. The main drawbacks of WSNs concern to the issue of network lifetime, coverage area, scheduling and data aggregation. In particular, prolonging network lifetime confirms the success together with the energy conservation of sensor nodes, data transmission reliability and scalability of their operation in data aggregation. Clustering schemes are considered to be highly suitable for effectively utilising the resources with lower overhead, such that energy consumption is enhanced for upgrading the network lifespan. In this paper, a Hybrid Modified Artificial Bee Colony and Firefly Algorithm (HMABCFA) -Based Cluster Head Selection is proposed for ensuring energy stabilisation, delay minimisation and inter-node distance reduction for improving the network lifetime. This proposed HMABCFA integrates the benefit of the Firefly optimisation algorithm for generating a new position that which has the capability of replacing the position, which is not updated in the scout bee phase of ABC. This incorporation of Firefly optimisation algorithm into the ABC algorithm prevents the limitations of premature convergence, slow convergence and the possibility of being trapped into the local point of optimality in the clustering process. The modified ABC-based clustering process is phenomenal in improving the feasible dimensions for enhancing the process of exploitation and exploration. The results of the HMABCFA, on an average are confirmed to enhance the network lifetime by 23.21%, energy stability by 19.84% and reduce network latency by 22.88%, compared to the benchmarked approaches.",
