The available traffic volume and occupancy are captured by sensors located on the Sathorn area\u2019s links. Induction loop coil sensors and thermal and CCTV cameras have been installed at the approaching links of the critical Sathorn-Surasak intersection. Traffic volume data have been collected from the CCTV cameras every 5 s from 2016 to 2019, and occupancy and volume data have been collected from the loop coil sensors every 5 s from May to September 2016 during a social experiment that was part of Sathorn Model project. Occupancy and volume data have also been collected from the thermal cameras every 5 s from May to June 2016. The dataset provides temporal and spatial coverage of Sathorn Road\u2019s primary urban areas, including weekdays, weekends, and public holidays. This dataset can be resources for research on traffic state estimation, traffic light control optimization, and the analysis of critical intersections.",

The available traffic volume and occupancy are captured by sensors located on the Sathorn area\u2019s links. Induction loop coil sensors and thermal and CCTV cameras have been installed at the approaching links of the critical Sathorn-Surasak intersection. Traffic volume data have been collected from the CCTV cameras every 5 s from 2016 to 2019, and occupancy and volume data have been collected from the loop coil sensors every 5 s from May to September 2016 during a social experiment that was part of Sathorn Model project. Occupancy and volume data have also been collected from the thermal cameras every 5 s from May to June 2016. The dataset provides temporal and spatial coverage of Sathorn Road\u2019s primary urban areas, including weekdays, weekends, and public holidays. This dataset can be resources for research on traffic state estimation, traffic light control optimization, and the analysis of critical intersections.",
