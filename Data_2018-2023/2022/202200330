                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s).The merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1) is a prime candidate for an asexual blood stage vaccine against malaria. However, polymorphism in this antigen could compromise the vaccine\u2019s efficacy. Although the extent of sequence variation in MSP1 has been analyzed from various Plasmodium species, little is known about structural organization and diversity of this locus in Plasmodium malariae (PmMSP1). Herein, we have shown that PmMSP1 contained five conserved and four variable blocks based on analysis of the complete coding sequences. Variable blocks were characterized by short insertion and deletion variants (block II), polymorphic nonrepeat sequences (block IV), complex repeat structure with size variation (block VI) and degenerate octapeptide repeats (block VIII). Like other malarial MSP1s, evidences of intragenic recombination have been found in PmMSP1. The rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions significantly exceeded that of synonymous nucleotide substitutions in block IV, suggesting positive selection in this region. Codon-based analysis of deviation from neutrality has identified a codon under purifying selection located in close proximity to the homologous region of the 38 kDa/42 kDa cleavage site of P. falciparum MSP1. A number of predicted linear B-cell epitopes were identified across both conserved and variable blocks of the protein. However, polymorphism in repeat-containing blocks resulted in alteration of the predicted linear B-cell epitope scores across variants. Although a number of predicted HLA-class II-binding peptides were identified in PmMSP1, all variants of block IV seemed not to be recognized by common HLA-class II alleles among Thai population, suggesting that diversity in this positive selection region could probably affect host immune recognition. The data on structural diversity in PmMSP1 could be useful for further studies such as vaccine development and strain characterization of this neglected malaria parasite.",

However, polymorphism in this antigen could compromise the vaccine\u2019s efficacy. Although the extent of sequence variation in MSP1 has been analyzed from various Plasmodium species, little is known about structural organization and diversity of this locus in Plasmodium malariae (PmMSP1). Herein, we have shown that PmMSP1 contained five conserved and four variable blocks based on analysis of the complete coding sequences. Variable blocks were characterized by short insertion and deletion variants (block II), polymorphic nonrepeat sequences (block IV), complex repeat structure with size variation (block VI) and degenerate octapeptide repeats (block VIII). Like other malarial MSP1s, evidences of intragenic recombination have been found in PmMSP1. The rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions significantly exceeded that of synonymous nucleotide substitutions in block IV, suggesting positive selection in this region. Codon-based analysis of deviation from neutrality has identified a codon under purifying selection located in close proximity to the homologous region of the 38 kDa/42 kDa cleavage site of P. falciparum MSP1. A number of predicted linear B-cell epitopes were identified across both conserved and variable blocks of the protein. However, polymorphism in repeat-containing blocks resulted in alteration of the predicted linear B-cell epitope scores across variants. Although a number of predicted HLA-class II-binding peptides were identified in PmMSP1, all variants of block IV seemed not to be recognized by common HLA-class II alleles among Thai population, suggesting that diversity in this positive selection region could probably affect host immune recognition. The data on structural diversity in PmMSP1 could be useful for further studies such as vaccine development and strain characterization of this neglected malaria parasite.",
