                "abstracts": "© 2022 The Author(s)Introduction: The genetic impact directly or indirectly predefines maxillofacial dimensions, potentially leading to an inappropriate relationship of the jaws and subsequently skeletal malocclusion. Previous studies focused mainly on genetic polymorphisms and class III malocclusion. This study was set out to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in two genes BMP2 (rs235768) and MYO1H (rs11066446) with Class II division 1 malocclusion, skeletal variation in vertical plane, and maxillary and mandibular jaws length. Subjects and methods: Sixty patients classified as Skeletal Class I (n = 30) and Class II division 1 (n = 30) were recruited. DNA was extracted from saliva and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were measured for the anterio-posterior relationship of maxillary and mandibular arch using digital tracing. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis of genotype frequencies was performed using Chi-square test to compare genotype distribution among groups and multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted by gender was also performed. Results: The rs235768 polymorphism in BMP2 was associated with hypodivergent face, increased maxillary length, and decreased mandibular length. Meanwhile, the rs11066446 polymorphism in MYO1H was associated with decreased mandibular length. New polymorphism was identified in MYO1H (rs10850090) in association with decreased mandibular length. Conclusion: A potential association between polymorpisms in BMP2 rs235768 and MOY1H rs11066446 and rs10850090 and Class II division 1 skeletal malocclusion related phenotypes exists, however, the degree of it has to be further investigated and yet to be discovered.",

        "dc:description": "Introduction: The genetic impact directly or indirectly predefines maxillofacial dimensions, potentially leading to an inappropriate relationship of the jaws and subsequently skeletal malocclusion. Previous studies focused mainly on genetic polymorphisms and class III malocclusion. This study was set out to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in two genes BMP2 (rs235768) and MYO1H (rs11066446) with Class II division 1 malocclusion, skeletal variation in vertical plane, and maxillary and mandibular jaws length. Subjects and methods: Sixty patients classified as Skeletal Class I (n = 30) and Class II division 1 (n = 30) were recruited. DNA was extracted from saliva and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were measured for the anterio-posterior relationship of maxillary and mandibular arch using digital tracing. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis of genotype frequencies was performed using Chi-square test to compare genotype distribution among groups and multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted by gender was also performed. Results: The rs235768 polymorphism in BMP2 was associated with hypodivergent face, increased maxillary length, and decreased mandibular length. Meanwhile, the rs11066446 polymorphism in MYO1H was associated with decreased mandibular length. New polymorphism was identified in MYO1H (rs10850090) in association with decreased mandibular length. Conclusion: A potential association between polymorpisms in BMP2 rs235768 and MOY1H rs11066446 and rs10850090 and Class II division 1 skeletal malocclusion related phenotypes exists, however, the degree of it has to be further investigated and yet to be discovered.",
