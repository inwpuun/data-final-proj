However, these tests are subjectively interpreted. We thus evaluated the interobserver and intra-observer reliability of each test. METHODS: The 3 eyelid tests were performed in ptotic patients associated with various conditions, including OMG and others. Video clips of all tests were recorded using smartphone with built-in camera in the following order; LFT, CLT, and FECT. All video clips were distributed to 3 neuro-ophthalmologists and 3 general ophthalmologists, who were trained to evaluate the tests using a single standard instruction. After 3 months, all video clips were re-organized for the second evaluation. Interobserver and intra-observer reliability were calculated using Cohens' Kappa coefficient and Fleiss Kappa statistic. RESULTS: The 3 eyelid tests were performed and recorded in 35 patients, which included the diagnosis of OMG, levator muscle dehiscence, partial oculomotor nerve palsy, and Horner syndrome. CLT received moderate-to-substantial interobserver reliability in neuro-ophthalmologist group (Fleiss Kappa 0.77 [95% CI 0.60-0.94] and 0.66 [95% CI 0.46-0.85] in first and second evaluation respectively), but the results varied in general ophthalmologist group (Fleiss Kappa 0.58 [95% CI 0.37-0.79] and 0.54 [95% CI 0.33-0.76] in first and second evaluation respectively). FECT and LFT received lower interobserver reliability in both groups. CLT also received moderate-to-almost perfect intra-observer reliability in neuro-ophthalmologist group (Cohen Kappa 0.55, 0.58, and 0.92), whereas FECT and LFT received lower intra-observer reliability. The intra-observer reliability varied among general ophthalmologists for all 3 eyelid tests. CONCLUSIONS: CLT is the most reliable test among the 3 eyelid tests. However, all tests should be interpreted with caution by general ophthalmologists.",
