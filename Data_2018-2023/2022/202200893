                "abstracts": "© 2022 The Author(s)Background: Aging is closely associated to several deleterious conditions and cognitive impairment. Administration of low-dose paracetamol (APAP) has previously been reported to improve cognitive performance in both human and animal studies. However, the altered cognitive effects of low-dose APAP treatment in the aging brain have not been elucidated. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether low-dose APAP treatment improves cognitive dysfunction in a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging model. Materials and methods: APAP (15 and 50 mg/kg p.o.) and vitamin E (Vit E 100 mg/kg p.o.) were administered once daily to D-gal-injected mice (200 mg/kg s.c.) for 6 weeks. The elevated plus maze (EPM), open field, novel object recognition (NOR), and Morris water maze (MWM) tests, respectively, were used to measure altered neurobehavioral functions, including anxiety-like behavior and exploratory locomotor activity, as well as learning and memory performance. The gene transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling in brain tissues was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Compared to the control, D-gal significantly decreased exploratory locomotor activity and NOR and MWM performance but did not significantly change the activity in the EPM test. However, APAP50 and Vit E significantly reversed the effects of D-gal injection on exploratory locomotor activity. In addition, low-dose APAP (15 and 50 mg/kg) and Vit E significantly improved the reduction in NOR and MWM performance induced by D-gal. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the mRNA expression of BDNF, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), which is the gene coding TrkB receptor, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the D-gal mice. However, APAP50 and Vit E significantly increased BDNF and NTRK mRNA expression in both the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. A lower dose of APAP (15 mg/kg) significantly elevated the mRNA expression of NTRK, but only in the hippocampus. Moreover, APAP50 significantly increased CREB mRNA expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Conclusion: Low-dose APAP treatment has a neuroprotective effect on cognitive dysfunction in the D-gal aging model, and the underlying molecular mechanisms depend on the activation of BDNF/TrkB signaling.",

                        "$": "The aging brain is widely recognized to contribute to anxiety, and several lines of evidence have revealed increased anxiety-like behavior in the D-gal-induced aging brain [40, 41]. In the present study, however, we did not detect a significant change in the indicators of increased anxiety in D-gal-induced mice. However, a trend toward increased anxiety indices, including a decreased number of entries and time spent in open areas, was observed in D-gal mice. Previous studies have shown that injection of D-gal at a dose of 500 mg/kg for 6 weeks induces anxiety-like behavior in mice [40, 41]. Together with these results, it might be suggested that dose- and regimen-dependent D-gal administration contributes to anxiety-like behavior. A higher dose can easily induce deteriorating results and/or a longer duration of treatment may result in obvious exhibition. A trend toward decreased anxiety (increased number of entries and time spent in the open area) was observed in mice treated with low doses of APAP (15 and 50 mg/kg). In 2018, Chen et al. reported that treatment with 50 mg/kg APAP reduced nerve injury-associated anxiety, probably by reducing neuropathic pain [42]. Another study found that APAP mediates anxiolytic-like effects via cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors [30]. Therefore, the results of the present study support the idea that APAP has anxiolytic effects, and low doses of APAP may exert anxiolytic properties in the D-gal-induced senescence model.Dr. Laddawan Lalert was supported by Walailak University [WU-IRG-63-083].",

        "dc:description": "Background: Aging is closely associated to several deleterious conditions and cognitive impairment. Administration of low-dose paracetamol (APAP) has previously been reported to improve cognitive performance in both human and animal studies. However, the altered cognitive effects of low-dose APAP treatment in the aging brain have not been elucidated. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether low-dose APAP treatment improves cognitive dysfunction in a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging model. Materials and methods: APAP (15 and 50 mg/kg p.o.) and vitamin E (Vit E 100 mg/kg p.o.) were administered once daily to D-gal-injected mice (200 mg/kg s.c.) for 6 weeks. The elevated plus maze (EPM), open field, novel object recognition (NOR), and Morris water maze (MWM) tests, respectively, were used to measure altered neurobehavioral functions, including anxiety-like behavior and exploratory locomotor activity, as well as learning and memory performance. The gene transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling in brain tissues was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Compared to the control, D-gal significantly decreased exploratory locomotor activity and NOR and MWM performance but did not significantly change the activity in the EPM test. However, APAP50 and Vit E significantly reversed the effects of D-gal injection on exploratory locomotor activity. In addition, low-dose APAP (15 and 50 mg/kg) and Vit E significantly improved the reduction in NOR and MWM performance induced by D-gal. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the mRNA expression of BDNF, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK), which is the gene coding TrkB receptor, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the D-gal mice. However, APAP50 and Vit E significantly increased BDNF and NTRK mRNA expression in both the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. A lower dose of APAP (15 mg/kg) significantly elevated the mRNA expression of NTRK, but only in the hippocampus. Moreover, APAP50 significantly increased CREB mRNA expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Conclusion: Low-dose APAP treatment has a neuroprotective effect on cognitive dysfunction in the D-gal aging model, and the underlying molecular mechanisms depend on the activation of BDNF/TrkB signaling.",
