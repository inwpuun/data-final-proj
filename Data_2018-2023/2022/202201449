This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The COVID-19 pandemic is found to be one of the external stimuli that greatly affects mobility of people, leading to a shift of transportation modes towards private individual ones. To properly explain the change in people\u2019s transport behavior, especially in pre- and post- pandemic periods, a tensor-based framework is herein proposed and applied to Pun Pun\u2013the only public bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand\u2013where multidimensional trip data of Pun Pun are decomposed into four different modes related to their spatial and temporal dimensions by a non-negative Tucker decomposition approach. According to our computational results, the first pandemic wave has a sizable influence not only on Pun Pun but also on other modes of transportation. Nonetheless, Pun Pun is relatively more resilient, as it recovers more quickly than other public transportation modes. In terms of trip patterns, we find that, prior to the pandemic, trips made during weekdays are dominated by business trips with two peak periods (morning and evening peaks), while those made during weekends are more related to leisure activities as they involve stations nearby a public park. However, after the first pandemic wave ends, the patterns of weekday trips have been drastically changed, as the number of business trips sharply drops, while that of educational trips connecting metro/subway stations with a major educational institute in the region significantly rises. These findings may be regarded as a reflection of the ever-changing transport behavior of people seeking a sustainable mode of private transport, with a more positive outlook on the use of bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand.",

        "dc:description": "The COVID-19 pandemic is found to be one of the external stimuli that greatly affects mobility of people, leading to a shift of transportation modes towards private individual ones. To properly explain the change in people\u2019s transport behavior, especially in pre- and post- pandemic periods, a tensor-based framework is herein proposed and applied to Pun Pun\u2013the only public bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand\u2013where multidimensional trip data of Pun Pun are decomposed into four different modes related to their spatial and temporal dimensions by a non-negative Tucker decomposition approach. According to our computational results, the first pandemic wave has a sizable influence not only on Pun Pun but also on other modes of transportation. Nonetheless, Pun Pun is relatively more resilient, as it recovers more quickly than other public transportation modes. In terms of trip patterns, we find that, prior to the pandemic, trips made during weekdays are dominated by business trips with two peak periods (morning and evening peaks), while those made during weekends are more related to leisure activities as they involve stations nearby a public park. However, after the first pandemic wave ends, the patterns of weekday trips have been drastically changed, as the number of business trips sharply drops, while that of educational trips connecting metro/subway stations with a major educational institute in the region significantly rises. These findings may be regarded as a reflection of the ever-changing transport behavior of people seeking a sustainable mode of private transport, with a more positive outlook on the use of bicycle-sharing system in Bangkok, Thailand.",
