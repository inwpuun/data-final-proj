All rights reserved.Due to the accident consequence of Fukushima Daiichi NPPs, the public acceptance of nuclear energy has decreased in many countries including Thailand. To overcome the public acceptance challenge in Thailand, it is important to understand the public perception in a wide range to improve the proper nuclear energy learning. Currently, analysis of social media is a significant approach to understanding public perception with large comments and expressions. Machine learning is a popular technique that was used to learn big data from social media platforms to create models to predict public perception. The authors applied machine learning to understand and predict the public perception of nuclear energy through social media in Thailand. The objective was to develop classification models for public perception of the nuclear energy of Thai people on social media platforms focusing on Facebook using machine learning in order to use the classification models to understand the public perceptions that people have a neutral opinion or biased opinion on nuclear energy news. The selected Facebook news related to the update of nuclear power plant technology was learned in the machine learning process to compare the ability of the classification models and select the proper model to be representative. In the authors' judgment, the majority (74%) of the comments on Facebook were the people who have neutral opinions. Thus, it is the opportunity of Thailand on behalf of the country not having NPPs to convince these people to understand the proper nuclear perception to support the direction of the future nuclear energy plan in Thailand. In the evaluation of the model, the accuracy of the selected classification model was only 58% of the author's judgments results. The improvement in the perception categorization step in the language translation was needed to improve the model accuracy for future work.",

To overcome the public acceptance challenge in Thailand, it is important to understand the public perception in a wide range to improve the proper nuclear energy learning. Currently, analysis of social media is a significant approach to understanding public perception with large comments and expressions. Machine learning is a popular technique that was used to learn big data from social media platforms to create models to predict public perception. The authors applied machine learning to understand and predict the public perception of nuclear energy through social media in Thailand. The objective was to develop classification models for public perception of the nuclear energy of Thai people on social media platforms focusing on Facebook using machine learning in order to use the classification models to understand the public perceptions that people have a neutral opinion or biased opinion on nuclear energy news. The selected Facebook news related to the update of nuclear power plant technology was learned in the machine learning process to compare the ability of the classification models and select the proper model to be representative. In the authors' judgment, the majority (74%) of the comments on Facebook were the people who have neutral opinions. Thus, it is the opportunity of Thailand on behalf of the country not having NPPs to convince these people to understand the proper nuclear perception to support the direction of the future nuclear energy plan in Thailand. In the evaluation of the model, the accuracy of the selected classification model was only 58% of the author's judgments results. The improvement in the perception categorization step in the language translation was needed to improve the model accuracy for future work.",
