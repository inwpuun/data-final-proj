                "abstracts": "© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The high use of gasoline and diesel vehicles results in environmental pollution and loss of natural resources. The use of electric vehicles can be socially beneficial and reduce air pollution. In this research study, the main aims are to identify the potential of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Pakistan using a Stated Preferences (SP) survey. An SP questionnaire was designed using the theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This questionnaire consisted of travelers\u2019 personal and travel characteristics and various statements designed to address the variables of TPB such as Attitudes Towards the Electric Vehicles, Subjective Norms (SN), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), and Behavioral Intentions (BI). The behavior items were designed in the context of travelers\u2019 willingness to buy and use EVs. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) were conducted to validate the designed hypotheses related to the variables of TPB. The cross-analysis revealed that there are variations in responses across different occupations, trip distances, travel modes, and vehicle ownership. The developed structural models showed that the Attitudes and PBC have a positive influence on BI and PBC, which also have a direct impact on travelers\u2019 willingness to use EV. The SN, PBC, and Attitudes are significant predictors of behavioral intentions in the willingness to buy EV and PBC is not a direct predictor of travelers\u2019 willingness to buy an EV. The BI acts as a mediator to explain the indirect effects of Attitudes, SN, and PBC on willingness to purchase and use an EV. In the end, a framework is also proposed for the behavior-related interventions to promote the EVs considering the socio-economic context of Pakistan.",

        "dc:description": "The high use of gasoline and diesel vehicles results in environmental pollution and loss of natural resources. The use of electric vehicles can be socially beneficial and reduce air pollution. In this research study, the main aims are to identify the potential of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Pakistan using a Stated Preferences (SP) survey. An SP questionnaire was designed using the theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This questionnaire consisted of travelers\u2019 personal and travel characteristics and various statements designed to address the variables of TPB such as Attitudes Towards the Electric Vehicles, Subjective Norms (SN), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), and Behavioral Intentions (BI). The behavior items were designed in the context of travelers\u2019 willingness to buy and use EVs. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) were conducted to validate the designed hypotheses related to the variables of TPB. The cross-analysis revealed that there are variations in responses across different occupations, trip distances, travel modes, and vehicle ownership. The developed structural models showed that the Attitudes and PBC have a positive influence on BI and PBC, which also have a direct impact on travelers\u2019 willingness to use EV. The SN, PBC, and Attitudes are significant predictors of behavioral intentions in the willingness to buy EV and PBC is not a direct predictor of travelers\u2019 willingness to buy an EV. The BI acts as a mediator to explain the indirect effects of Attitudes, SN, and PBC on willingness to purchase and use an EV. In the end, a framework is also proposed for the behavior-related interventions to promote the EVs considering the socio-economic context of Pakistan.",
