                "abstracts": "© 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objective: This study aims to examine the effects of methamphetamine (MA) use and dependence and MA withdrawal symptoms on the telomere length and whether shortening of the latter is associated with MA-induced psychosis (MIP). Methods: This study included 185 MA-abuse, 118 MA-dependent, and 67 MIP patients, diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. The Semi-structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA) questionnaire was employed to collect MA-related data. MIP was confirmed using the Methamphetamine Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). The leukocyte telomere length was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction measuring the Telomere/Single gene ratio (T/S ratio). Data were analysed using multivariate statistical analyses. Results: There were no significant associations between the T/S ratio and severity of MA-use, MIP, and MA withdrawal symptoms. MIP was significantly predicted by alcohol dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and MA-use severity. There were significantly positive associations between the T/S ratio and previous traumatic and life-threatening events. The T/S ratio was not affected by alcohol and nicotine dependence. Alcohol and nicotine dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and severity of MA use increased risk of MA withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion: MIP and MA-use severity are not associated with leukocyte telomere length, but previous traumatic and life-threatening events are associated with increased telomere length.",

Methods: This study included 185 MA-abuse, 118 MA-dependent, and 67 MIP patients, diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. The Semi-structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism (SSADDA) questionnaire was employed to collect MA-related data. MIP was confirmed using the Methamphetamine Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). The leukocyte telomere length was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction measuring the Telomere/Single gene ratio (T/S ratio). Data were analysed using multivariate statistical analyses. Results: There were no significant associations between the T/S ratio and severity of MA-use, MIP, and MA withdrawal symptoms. MIP was significantly predicted by alcohol dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and MA-use severity. There were significantly positive associations between the T/S ratio and previous traumatic and life-threatening events. The T/S ratio was not affected by alcohol and nicotine dependence. Alcohol and nicotine dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and severity of MA use increased risk of MA withdrawal symptoms. Conclusion: MIP and MA-use severity are not associated with leukocyte telomere length, but previous traumatic and life-threatening events are associated with increased telomere length.",
