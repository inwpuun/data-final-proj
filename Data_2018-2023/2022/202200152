                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s).Tumors frequently found in dogs include canine oral tumors, either cancerous or noncancerous. The bloodstream is an important route for tumor metastasis, particularly for late-stage oral melanoma (LOM) and late-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (LOSCC). The present study aimed to investigate serum peptidome-based biomarkers of dogs with early-stage oral melanoma, LOM, LOSCC, benign oral tumors, chronic periodontitis and healthy controls, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A principal component analysis plot showed distinct clusters among all groups. Four peptides were identified, including peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4 isoform X2 (FKBP4), steroid hormone receptor ERR1 (ESRRA or ERRA), immunoglobulin superfamily member 10 (IGSF10) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5). FKBP4, ESRRA and ABCB5 were found to be overexpressed in both LOM and LOSCC, whereas IGSF10 expression was markedly increased in LOSCC only. These four proteins also played a crucial role in numerous pathways of cancer metastasis and showed a strong relationship with chemotherapy drugs. In conclusion, this study showed rapid screening of canine oral tumors using serum and MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, potential serum peptidome-based biomarker candidates for LOM and LOSCC were identified.",

The bloodstream is an important route for tumor metastasis, particularly for late-stage oral melanoma (LOM) and late-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (LOSCC). The present study aimed to investigate serum peptidome-based biomarkers of dogs with early-stage oral melanoma, LOM, LOSCC, benign oral tumors, chronic periodontitis and healthy controls, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A principal component analysis plot showed distinct clusters among all groups. Four peptides were identified, including peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4 isoform X2 (FKBP4), steroid hormone receptor ERR1 (ESRRA or ERRA), immunoglobulin superfamily member 10 (IGSF10) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5 (ABCB5). FKBP4, ESRRA and ABCB5 were found to be overexpressed in both LOM and LOSCC, whereas IGSF10 expression was markedly increased in LOSCC only. These four proteins also played a crucial role in numerous pathways of cancer metastasis and showed a strong relationship with chemotherapy drugs. In conclusion, this study showed rapid screening of canine oral tumors using serum and MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, potential serum peptidome-based biomarker candidates for LOM and LOSCC were identified.",
