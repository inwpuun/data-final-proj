                "abstracts": "© 2022, Association of Canadian Archivists. All rights reserved.Traditional Thai archival practice, which consists of documenting events and ceremonies, can be traced to the activities of royal scribes in past centuries. Today, this practice is carried out by national archivists, far removed from people\u2019s daily lives. However, current digital transformations and partici-patory, networked culture are making documentation more relevant now than in the past \u2013 and to virtually everyone. Focusing on records from times of historic emergencies, this article aims to understand Thai documentation behaviour from a socio-cultural perspective, with an eye toward considering how to adjust traditional archival practice to the contemporary Thai context. Archival sources documenting two crises \u2013 the Franco-Siamese military conflict of 1893 and a catastrophic tropical storm in southern Thailand in 1962 \u2013 are compared with new social media\u2013based documentation consisting of posts, comments, and other activity during the cave rescue incident in northern Thailand in 2018. This comparison is complemented by insights from national archivists and other documentation experts regarding their experiences and their thoughts on the future of Thai archival practice. Together, this comparison and these insights show that Thai documentation retained some of its original principles and functions in Thai society when it moved into a digital landscape, but there is still room for it to become more engaging and, in some ways, better suited to common understandings of archives as a \u201chall of fame.\u201d This article suggests that Thai archivists should embrace a participatory archives model in which professional archivists remain essential but shift their focus from recording and guarding information to fostering the reliability and sustainability of documentation.",
