                "abstracts": "© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: The first step in renal urine formation is ultrafiltration across the glomerular barrier. The change in its nanostructure has been associated with nephrotic syndromes. Effects of physiological and hemodynamic factor alterations associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN) on glomerular permselectivity are examined through a mathematical model employing low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics and hindered transport theory. Methods: Glomerular capillaries are represented as networks of cylindrical tubes with multilayered walls. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a fibrous medium with bimodal fiber sizes. Epithelial slit fiber spacing follows a lognormal distribution based on reported electron micrographs with the highest resolution. Endothelial fenestrae are filled with fibers the size of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Effects of fiber-macromolecule steric and hydrodynamic interactions are included. Focusing on diabetic nephropathy, the physiological and hemodynamic factors employed in the computation are those reported for healthy humans and patients with early-but-overt diabetic nephropathy. The macromolecule concentration is obtained as a finite element solution of the convection-diffusion equation. Results: Computed sieving coefficients averaged along the capillary length agree well with ficoll sieving coefficients from studies in humans for most solute radii. GBM thickening and the loss of the slit diaphragm hardly affect glomerular permselectivity. GAG volume fraction reduction in the endothelial fenestrae, however, significantly increases macromolecule filtration. Increased renal plasma flow rate (RPF), glomerular hypertension, and reduction of lumen osmotic pressure cause a slight sieving coefficient decrease. These effects are amplified by an increased macromolecule size. Conclusion: Our results indicate that glomerular hypertension and the reduction in the oncotic pressure decreases glomerular macromolecule filtration. Reduction of RPF and changes in the glomerular barrier structure associated with DN, however, increase the solute sieving. Damage to GAGs caused by hyperglycemia is likely to be the most prominent factor affecting glomerular size-selectivity.",

        "dc:description": "Objective: The first step in renal urine formation is ultrafiltration across the glomerular barrier. The change in its nanostructure has been associated with nephrotic syndromes. Effects of physiological and hemodynamic factor alterations associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN) on glomerular permselectivity are examined through a mathematical model employing low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics and hindered transport theory. Methods: Glomerular capillaries are represented as networks of cylindrical tubes with multilayered walls. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a fibrous medium with bimodal fiber sizes. Epithelial slit fiber spacing follows a lognormal distribution based on reported electron micrographs with the highest resolution. Endothelial fenestrae are filled with fibers the size of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Effects of fiber-macromolecule steric and hydrodynamic interactions are included. Focusing on diabetic nephropathy, the physiological and hemodynamic factors employed in the computation are those reported for healthy humans and patients with early-but-overt diabetic nephropathy. The macromolecule concentration is obtained as a finite element solution of the convection-diffusion equation. Results: Computed sieving coefficients averaged along the capillary length agree well with ficoll sieving coefficients from studies in humans for most solute radii. GBM thickening and the loss of the slit diaphragm hardly affect glomerular permselectivity. GAG volume fraction reduction in the endothelial fenestrae, however, significantly increases macromolecule filtration. Increased renal plasma flow rate (RPF), glomerular hypertension, and reduction of lumen osmotic pressure cause a slight sieving coefficient decrease. These effects are amplified by an increased macromolecule size. Conclusion: Our results indicate that glomerular hypertension and the reduction in the oncotic pressure decreases glomerular macromolecule filtration. Reduction of RPF and changes in the glomerular barrier structure associated with DN, however, increase the solute sieving. Damage to GAGs caused by hyperglycemia is likely to be the most prominent factor affecting glomerular size-selectivity.",
