                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: The highest dropout rate for medical students is during the preclinical years of education. Several studies have reported possible contributing factors, however, studies regarding the dropout rate from medical education among Thai medical students and its associated factors are still lacking. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of dropout from medical education within the preclinical period and its associated factors among Thai medical students. Methods: We collected data from preclinical medical students who entered one medical school in Bangkok, Thailand, between 2017\u20132019. Demographic data, admission program, pre-admission mental health status assessed by the Thai Mental Health Indicator 66, mental health records from the faculty-based counseling services, and academic achievement were extracted. Data were reported in a descriptive fashion. We analyzed the association between dropout and these factors by robust Poisson regression. Results: In total, 914 students were recruited. Dropout was only 1.5%, which was lower than the previous studies. Regression analysis showed a significant association between dropout and mental health problems [Prevalence ratio (PR) 58.20, 95%CI 13.72- 246.95] but not admission program [PR 0.32, 95%CI 0.09 \u2013 1.16] or failing examinations [PR 0.59, 95%CI 0.18 \u2013 1.90]. However, other contributing factors such as financial status, family problems, medical illness, and students\u2019 motivation, were not evaluated in this study. Conclusions: Mental health problems during medical education were associated with dropout after adjusting for other confounding variables. Further longitudinal studies are needed to identify the impacts of academic failure on dropout in higher clinical years.",

Several studies have reported possible contributing factors, however, studies regarding the dropout rate from medical education among Thai medical students and its associated factors are still lacking. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of dropout from medical education within the preclinical period and its associated factors among Thai medical students. Methods: We collected data from preclinical medical students who entered one medical school in Bangkok, Thailand, between 2017\u20132019. Demographic data, admission program, pre-admission mental health status assessed by the Thai Mental Health Indicator 66, mental health records from the faculty-based counseling services, and academic achievement were extracted. Data were reported in a descriptive fashion. We analyzed the association between dropout and these factors by robust Poisson regression. Results: In total, 914 students were recruited. Dropout was only 1.5%, which was lower than the previous studies. Regression analysis showed a significant association between dropout and mental health problems [Prevalence ratio (PR) 58.20, 95%CI 13.72- 246.95] but not admission program [PR 0.32, 95%CI 0.09 \u2013 1.16] or failing examinations [PR 0.59, 95%CI 0.18 \u2013 1.90]. However, other contributing factors such as financial status, family problems, medical illness, and students\u2019 motivation, were not evaluated in this study. Conclusions: Mental health problems during medical education were associated with dropout after adjusting for other confounding variables. Further longitudinal studies are needed to identify the impacts of academic failure on dropout in higher clinical years.",
