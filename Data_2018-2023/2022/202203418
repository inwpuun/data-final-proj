Bonk and Meina Zhu; individual chapters, the contributors.In this chapter, the author aimed at enabling one to understand how the language classroom in Thai context can shift from \u201cteacher centered\u201d to \u201cstudent centered\u201d by instilling some collaborative strategies into teaching and learning. A collaborative learning approach seemed to be the answer for this challenge since it required students to conduct activities, share ideas, and work collaboratively to complete a task successfully. Examples of these activities included role play, think-pair-share, and a jigsaw activity. However, amid the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, everything was disrupted and immediately shifted to online learning. What should be collaborative learning soon became individual learning (online), which was not suitable for young learners, especially in the language classroom. Once they return to the new normal classroom scene in the future, the author hopes to foster those moments of intense and engaging learning wherein her students collaborate and share ideas and knowledge with each other once again.",

Examples of these activities included role play, think-pair-share, and a jigsaw activity. However, amid the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, everything was disrupted and immediately shifted to online learning. What should be collaborative learning soon became individual learning (online), which was not suitable for young learners, especially in the language classroom. Once they return to the new normal classroom scene in the future, the author hopes to foster those moments of intense and engaging learning wherein her students collaborate and share ideas and knowledge with each other once again.",
