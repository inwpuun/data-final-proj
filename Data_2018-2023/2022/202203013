                "abstracts": "© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe bathyal Permian Nong Pong Formation is crucial for understanding the deformation style, and amount of shortening in the E-W trending, Triassic (Indosinian Orogeny) Khao Khwang Fold and Thrust Belt. The formation was deposited in a series of marine rift basins, with carbonates forming on intervening highs. The platform carbonates are shortened by a series of dominantly north-directed thrusts. The Nong Pong Formation is extensively affected by tight to isoclinal, predominantly chevron style folding. Five major variations in stratigraphy (ranging between carbonate-dominated and shale-dominated) affect the deformation styles within the formation. Shortening locally is estimated to be up to 60% in sections up to 300 m long and is concentrated into short-wavelength (10 s m) structures. The absence of proximal slope depo-belts, and juxtaposition of carbonate platform facies with deepwater deposits suggest thrusts (some initiated as inverted normal faults) located on the basin margins have displacements of c. 10\u201325 km. Estimates of shortening from outcrops, and analogy with Zealandia, suggest the Nong Pong Formation was deposited in a basin up to 100 km wide. Such estimates point to a significant E-W trending seaway that bisected the Indochina Terrane. Multiple fold orientations and phases are present in the Nong Pong Formation, which are related to early mass transport events, multiple tectonic phases (Indosinian and Palaeogene), the influence of inherited trends (e.g. Permian rift basin morphology), and 3D deformation during a single tectonic phase. Deformation of the Nong Pong Formation demonstrates significant differences in structural style between ribbon continents and major continents, particularly, the Indochina ribbon continent shows the widespread inversion of rift basins across a submarine continent (similar to Zealandia) 100 s kms wide.",

        "dc:description": "The bathyal Permian Nong Pong Formation is crucial for understanding the deformation style, and amount of shortening in the E-W trending, Triassic (Indosinian Orogeny) Khao Khwang Fold and Thrust Belt. The formation was deposited in a series of marine rift basins, with carbonates forming on intervening highs. The platform carbonates are shortened by a series of dominantly north-directed thrusts. The Nong Pong Formation is extensively affected by tight to isoclinal, predominantly chevron style folding. Five major variations in stratigraphy (ranging between carbonate-dominated and shale-dominated) affect the deformation styles within the formation. Shortening locally is estimated to be up to 60% in sections up to 300 m long and is concentrated into short-wavelength (10 s m) structures. The absence of proximal slope depo-belts, and juxtaposition of carbonate platform facies with deepwater deposits suggest thrusts (some initiated as inverted normal faults) located on the basin margins have displacements of c. 10\u201325 km. Estimates of shortening from outcrops, and analogy with Zealandia, suggest the Nong Pong Formation was deposited in a basin up to 100 km wide. Such estimates point to a significant E-W trending seaway that bisected the Indochina Terrane. Multiple fold orientations and phases are present in the Nong Pong Formation, which are related to early mass transport events, multiple tectonic phases (Indosinian and Palaeogene), the influence of inherited trends (e.g. Permian rift basin morphology), and 3D deformation during a single tectonic phase. Deformation of the Nong Pong Formation demonstrates significant differences in structural style between ribbon continents and major continents, particularly, the Indochina ribbon continent shows the widespread inversion of rift basins across a submarine continent (similar to Zealandia) 100 s kms wide.",
