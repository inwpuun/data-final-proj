                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Halotolerant species are of interest since they occur naturally in environments with excess toxic ions. The cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC 7418 (hereafter referred to as Halothece) exhibits remarkable halotolerance and was used to examine stress-responsive regulatory mechanisms. The effects of five different stimuli on Halothece transcriptomes were examined using RNA sequencing. In response to diverse stresses, there were both common and stress-specific transcriptional responses. A common upregulated gene set under all stresses consisted of nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also found that osmotic stress elicited the largest set of DEGs. Salt- and osmotic-responsive regulatory mechanisms shared common pathways. DEGs that were upregulated under salt stress encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis and related machineries. Furthermore, DEGs encoding two-component system (TCS) factors, transcriptional factors, scaffolds for protein\u2013protein interactions, transporters, protein turnover factors, and lipid biosynthesis enzymes were also identified under salt stress. Notably, one-carbon (1C) metabolism factors, glycine betaine (GB) synthesis enzymes, and GB transporters were upregulated under salt stress. Metabolic analyses revealed that GB accumulated under salt stress, while mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G) accumulated under salt or osmotic stress. None of the nutrient starvations induced GB nor M2G accumulation. These results suggested that GB and M2G are two osmoprotectants that contribute to halotolerance. Based on our results, we proposed regulatory mechanisms that are crucial for halotolerance, which are coordinated with the GB, M2G, 1C, amino acid, and central carbon interlinking metabolic pathways. 1C metabolism directly fulfills the high metabolite requirements for halotolerance together with the ancillary role of several metabolic pathways. Key Points \u2022 Global transcriptome surveys together with molecular and metabolite analyses provide insights into regulatory networks that are crucial for halotolerance \u2022 Regulatory networks that are crucial for halotolerance coordinated with the two key osmoprotectants, one carbon, amino acid, and central carbon interlinking metabolic pathways \u2022 The findings have translational relevance in genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of halotolerance",

        "dc:description": "Halotolerant species are of interest since they occur naturally in environments with excess toxic ions. The cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC 7418 (hereafter referred to as Halothece) exhibits remarkable halotolerance and was used to examine stress-responsive regulatory mechanisms. The effects of five different stimuli on Halothece transcriptomes were examined using RNA sequencing. In response to diverse stresses, there were both common and stress-specific transcriptional responses. A common upregulated gene set under all stresses consisted of nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also found that osmotic stress elicited the largest set of DEGs. Salt- and osmotic-responsive regulatory mechanisms shared common pathways. DEGs that were upregulated under salt stress encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis and related machineries. Furthermore, DEGs encoding two-component system (TCS) factors, transcriptional factors, scaffolds for protein\u2013protein interactions, transporters, protein turnover factors, and lipid biosynthesis enzymes were also identified under salt stress. Notably, one-carbon (1C) metabolism factors, glycine betaine (GB) synthesis enzymes, and GB transporters were upregulated under salt stress. Metabolic analyses revealed that GB accumulated under salt stress, while mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G) accumulated under salt or osmotic stress. None of the nutrient starvations induced GB nor M2G accumulation. These results suggested that GB and M2G are two osmoprotectants that contribute to halotolerance. Based on our results, we proposed regulatory mechanisms that are crucial for halotolerance, which are coordinated with the GB, M2G, 1C, amino acid, and central carbon interlinking metabolic pathways. 1C metabolism directly fulfills the high metabolite requirements for halotolerance together with the ancillary role of several metabolic pathways. Key Points \u2022 Global transcriptome surveys together with molecular and metabolite analyses provide insights into regulatory networks that are crucial for halotolerance \u2022 Regulatory networks that are crucial for halotolerance coordinated with the two key osmoprotectants, one carbon, amino acid, and central carbon interlinking metabolic pathways \u2022 The findings have translational relevance in genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of halotolerance",
