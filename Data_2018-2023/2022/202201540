This study aims to determine how caregiver knowledge and misconceptions, as assessed by our knowledge test, changed over a 12-month period following our educational program and whether the test score was associated with any demographics of the caregivers and children with tracheostomy. A prospective cohort study was undertaken to evaluate the knowledge at 3 timepoints after tracheostomy education: baseline (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12 months (T3). Test scores were analyzed for trend and relationship with demographics. Items for which less than 80% caregivers gave correct responses at T1 were considered common misconceptions. Fifty-four caregivers were enrolled. Out of a maximum score of 25, the median (IQR) scores were 22 (21-23), 23 (22-24), and 23 (22-25), at T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The scores at T2 and T3 were significantly higher than at T1 (P ≤.01). One common misconception \u201chow to manage when suction got less secretion than expected\u201d was found at all timepoints. Caregivers of children with >2 comorbidities scored slightly higher than those of children with 0 to 2 comorbidities (P =.01). In conclusion, our caregivers achieved high knowledge scores which increased over the 12-month study period potentially because of repeated assessment and practical experience. Common misconceptions and a factor associated with the knowledge were also identified. These advantages highlighted the importance of knowledge assessment for quality improvement.",

This study aims to determine how caregiver knowledge and misconceptions, as assessed by our knowledge test, changed over a 12-month period following our educational program and whether the test score was associated with any demographics of the caregivers and children with tracheostomy. A prospective cohort study was undertaken to evaluate the knowledge at 3 timepoints after tracheostomy education: baseline (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12 months (T3). Test scores were analyzed for trend and relationship with demographics. Items for which less than 80% caregivers gave correct responses at T1 were considered common misconceptions. Fifty-four caregivers were enrolled. Out of a maximum score of 25, the median (IQR) scores were 22 (21-23), 23 (22-24), and 23 (22-25), at T1, T2, and T3, respectively. The scores at T2 and T3 were significantly higher than at T1 (P ≤.01). One common misconception \u201chow to manage when suction got less secretion than expected\u201d was found at all timepoints. Caregivers of children with >2 comorbidities scored slightly higher than those of children with 0 to 2 comorbidities (P =.01). In conclusion, our caregivers achieved high knowledge scores which increased over the 12-month study period potentially because of repeated assessment and practical experience. Common misconceptions and a factor associated with the knowledge were also identified. These advantages highlighted the importance of knowledge assessment for quality improvement.",
