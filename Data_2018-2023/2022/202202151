            "xocs:funding-text": "The purpose of this study was to compare the impacts of traditional training with those of combining free-weight and elastic training with cluster sets during a 6-week period on PP, RPP, PF, RPF, and PV. Sixteen elite junior weightlifters volunteered to participate in this study. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups: control and CFEC. An undulatory periodized plan was employed for both groups. Both groups were required to perform a CP exercise with similar intensity. While the control group performed traditional free-weight training, CFEC employed a combined 90% free-weight and 10% elastic program with a 40-s rest between each repetition. PP, RPP, PF, RPF, and PV were assessed before the training and after 6 weeks using a modified CP exercise. The results showed that the combined elastic training and cluster sets were able to improve PP and RPP compared to the control group. However, the results found no statistical differences in PF, RPF, or PV between the two groups. Our results indicated the benefits of CFEC in which it was able to improve PP and RPP while controlling the injury risks. Moreover, our results implied that the combined free weight and elastic training with cluster sets during the clean pull exercise is an effective power training program for junior weightlifters. It is a safe training program with limited injury risks while significantly improving power production. Coaches, therefore, should consider employing the CFEC technique with CP to increase the power-to-weight ratio.

Sixteen male and female elite junior weightlifters volunteered to participate in this study. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups (control and CFEC) of eight participants (four males and four females) using match pairs of relative CP strength. An undulatory periodized plan with 85\u201393% CP strength was employed for both groups. Both groups were required to perform a CP exercise with similar intensity. While the control group performed a 100% of traditional free-weight training, CFEC employed combined 90% free-weight and 10% elastic training with a 40-s rest between repetitions. Peak power (PP), relative peak power (RPP), peak force (PF), relative peak force (RPF), and peak velocity (PV) were assessed by a ballistic measurement system before and after 6-week of training. The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test indicated that all dependent variables were normally distributed. Moreover, two independent t-tests were performed and confirmed that there were no statistical differences between the control and CFEC groups for all dependent variables at pre-test. ANCOVA was used to analyze dependent variables using pre-test values as covariates. The results showed the participants in CFEC significantly improved PP and RPP when compared to the control group at post-test (p<0.05). However, the results found no statistical differences in PF, RPF, or PV between the two groups. Our results indicated that CFEC is an effective training program for improving PP and RPP with minimal injury risks in junior weightlifters.",

        "dc:description": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of combined free-weight and elastic training with cluster sets (CFEC) on peak power during clean pull (CP) exercises on youth weightlifters. Sixteen male and female elite junior weightlifters volunteered to participate in this study. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups (control and CFEC) of eight participants (four males and four females) using match pairs of relative CP strength. An undulatory periodized plan with 85\u201393% CP strength was employed for both groups. Both groups were required to perform a CP exercise with similar intensity. While the control group performed a 100% of traditional free-weight training, CFEC employed combined 90% free-weight and 10% elastic training with a 40-s rest between repetitions. Peak power (PP), relative peak power (RPP), peak force (PF), relative peak force (RPF), and peak velocity (PV) were assessed by a ballistic measurement system before and after 6-week of training. The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test indicated that all dependent variables were normally distributed. Moreover, two independent t-tests were performed and confirmed that there were no statistical differences between the control and CFEC groups for all dependent variables at pre-test. ANCOVA was used to analyze dependent variables using pre-test values as covariates. The results showed the participants in CFEC significantly improved PP and RPP when compared to the control group at post-test (p<0.05). However, the results found no statistical differences in PF, RPF, or PV between the two groups. Our results indicated that CFEC is an effective training program for improving PP and RPP with minimal injury risks in junior weightlifters.",
