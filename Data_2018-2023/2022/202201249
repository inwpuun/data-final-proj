The blended SF/GA/Gly films were chemically conjugated with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), either native (TMV-wt) or genetically modified with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences (TMV-rgd), to improve cellular responses. The attachment and proliferation of L929 cells on TMV-decorated films were improved, possibly due to enhanced surface roughness. The cellular responses were pronounced with TMV-rgd, due to the proper decoration of RGD, which is an integrin recognition motif supporting cell binding. However, the biological results were inconclusive for human primary cells because of an innate slow growth kinetic of the cells. Additionally, the cells on SF/GA/Gly films were greater populated in S and G2/M phase, and the cell cycle arrest was notably increased in the TMV-conjugated group. Our findings revealed that the films modified with TMV were cytocompatible and the cellular responses were significantly enhanced when conjugated with its RGD mutants. The biological analysis on the cellular mechanisms in response to TMV is further required to ensure the safety concern of the biomaterials toward clinical translation.",

        "dc:description": "Flexible films were prepared from silk fibroin (SF) and gelatin (GA) with a presence of glycerol (Gly), followed by water vapor annealing to achieve water-insoluble matrices. The blended SF/GA/Gly films were chemically conjugated with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), either native (TMV-wt) or genetically modified with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences (TMV-rgd), to improve cellular responses. The attachment and proliferation of L929 cells on TMV-decorated films were improved, possibly due to enhanced surface roughness. The cellular responses were pronounced with TMV-rgd, due to the proper decoration of RGD, which is an integrin recognition motif supporting cell binding. However, the biological results were inconclusive for human primary cells because of an innate slow growth kinetic of the cells. Additionally, the cells on SF/GA/Gly films were greater populated in S and G2/M phase, and the cell cycle arrest was notably increased in the TMV-conjugated group. Our findings revealed that the films modified with TMV were cytocompatible and the cellular responses were significantly enhanced when conjugated with its RGD mutants. The biological analysis on the cellular mechanisms in response to TMV is further required to ensure the safety concern of the biomaterials toward clinical translation.",
