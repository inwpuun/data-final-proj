In this study, an epidemiological approach was used to explore the association between the presence of CanineCV and respiratory symptoms in dogs. Respiratory swabs were collected from 76 healthy dogs and 114 dogs with respiratory illness and tested for CanineCV using conventional PCR (cPCR). Furthermore, lung tissues collected from 15 necropsied dogs showing pneumonia were tested using the real-time PCR (qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) technique. A total of 8.95% (17/190) of dogs were CanineCV positive, with a significant association (p = 0.013) in dogs with respiratory signs. Four necropsied dogs were qPCR positive with the CanineCV-DNA labeling localized in tracheobronchial lymphoid cells (3/4), pulmonary parenchyma, capillary endothelia, and mononuclear cells harboring in alveoli (2/4). Full-length genome sequences of seven CanineCV strains were analyzed, indicating that the detected CanineCV genome clustered in the CanineCV-4 genotype. Genetic recombination was also evident in the replicase (Rep) gene. Although the role of CanineCV primarily affecting lung lesions could not be determined from this study, the presence of CanineCV DNA in pulmonary-associated cells indicated the potential association of the virus with canine respiratory disease; thus, linking causality must be examined in further studies.",

        "dc:description": "Although canine circovirus (CanineCV)-associated with gastroenteritis has been well documented, the virus is also detectable in the respiratory discharge of dogs with respiratory disease. In this study, an epidemiological approach was used to explore the association between the presence of CanineCV and respiratory symptoms in dogs. Respiratory swabs were collected from 76 healthy dogs and 114 dogs with respiratory illness and tested for CanineCV using conventional PCR (cPCR). Furthermore, lung tissues collected from 15 necropsied dogs showing pneumonia were tested using the real-time PCR (qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) technique. A total of 8.95% (17/190) of dogs were CanineCV positive, with a significant association (p = 0.013) in dogs with respiratory signs. Four necropsied dogs were qPCR positive with the CanineCV-DNA labeling localized in tracheobronchial lymphoid cells (3/4), pulmonary parenchyma, capillary endothelia, and mononuclear cells harboring in alveoli (2/4). Full-length genome sequences of seven CanineCV strains were analyzed, indicating that the detected CanineCV genome clustered in the CanineCV-4 genotype. Genetic recombination was also evident in the replicase (Rep) gene. Although the role of CanineCV primarily affecting lung lesions could not be determined from this study, the presence of CanineCV DNA in pulmonary-associated cells indicated the potential association of the virus with canine respiratory disease; thus, linking causality must be examined in further studies.",
