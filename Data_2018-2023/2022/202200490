Several epidemiological studies pointed out an association between quality of residential in inner city and risk of children health. However, few studies had been focused in high-polluted urban area in low to middle income countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the association between residential environments and respiratory symptoms including asthma among 658 primary school children living in urban area of Bangkok Thailand. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was modified to access symptoms during the past 12 months. Binary logistic regression model was performed. Living near garment and clothing shop is associated with shortness of breath (AOR = 1.846; 95% CI 1.034, 3.297). Vectors in home is related to dry cough at night (AOR = 1.505; 95% CI 1.052, 2.153) and phlegm (AOR = 1.414; 95% CI 1.014, 1.973). Wall dampness is increased odd of having wheezing or whistling (asthma) in the chest (AOR = 1.921; 95% CI 1.141, 3.235). Children age, gender, and a family history of asthma were modified the associations. Our finding may provide strategies focusing on living environment improvement with a specific group of children to address respiratory disease prevention.",

        "dc:description": "Respiratory disease and its complication are the cause of children deaths worldwide every year. Several epidemiological studies pointed out an association between quality of residential in inner city and risk of children health. However, few studies had been focused in high-polluted urban area in low to middle income countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the association between residential environments and respiratory symptoms including asthma among 658 primary school children living in urban area of Bangkok Thailand. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was modified to access symptoms during the past 12 months. Binary logistic regression model was performed. Living near garment and clothing shop is associated with shortness of breath (AOR = 1.846; 95% CI 1.034, 3.297). Vectors in home is related to dry cough at night (AOR = 1.505; 95% CI 1.052, 2.153) and phlegm (AOR = 1.414; 95% CI 1.014, 1.973). Wall dampness is increased odd of having wheezing or whistling (asthma) in the chest (AOR = 1.921; 95% CI 1.141, 3.235). Children age, gender, and a family history of asthma were modified the associations. Our finding may provide strategies focusing on living environment improvement with a specific group of children to address respiratory disease prevention.",
