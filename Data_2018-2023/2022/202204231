                "abstracts": "© 2020 The Child Care in Practice Group.Background: Parents have important roles to perceive the growth abnormalities of their children. Parental misperception can affect the children\u2019s long-term health problems. Aim: To investigate: (a) the accuracy of parents\u2019 perception of children\u2019s weight, height, and body shape, (b) the effects of misperception in caring for children\u2019s health, and (c) the factors of parental misperception. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a primary school in Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 1,153 parents completed self-administered questionnaires: (1) verbal perception of children\u2019s weight and height and (2) visual perception of children\u2019s body shape using Children\u2019s Body Image Scale developed by Truby H and Paxtron SJ. Results: The agreement of parents\u2019 perception and children\u2019s actual weight and height was fair (K = 0.33 and 0.27, respectively). While the agreement of parents\u2019 perception of boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 body shape was moderate (K = 0.43 and 0.48, respectively). Parents who underestimated children\u2019s weight and height were likely to seek medical care (OR = 1.92; 95% CI 1.39, 2.65 and OR = 3.73; 95% CI 2.56, 5.44, respectively). Nonetheless, parents tended to underestimate the boys\u2019 weight. Conclusion: Many parents do not accurately perceive their children\u2019s weight, height, and body shape. This misperception could influence their caring for children\u2019s health. Thus, educating parents about the perception of children\u2019s growth should be emphasized to avoid long-term health effects.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Parents have important roles to perceive the growth abnormalities of their children. Parental misperception can affect the children\u2019s long-term health problems. Aim: To investigate: (a) the accuracy of parents\u2019 perception of children\u2019s weight, height, and body shape, (b) the effects of misperception in caring for children\u2019s health, and (c) the factors of parental misperception. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a primary school in Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 1,153 parents completed self-administered questionnaires: (1) verbal perception of children\u2019s weight and height and (2) visual perception of children\u2019s body shape using Children\u2019s Body Image Scale developed by Truby H and Paxtron SJ. Results: The agreement of parents\u2019 perception and children\u2019s actual weight and height was fair (K = 0.33 and 0.27, respectively). While the agreement of parents\u2019 perception of boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 body shape was moderate (K = 0.43 and 0.48, respectively). Parents who underestimated children\u2019s weight and height were likely to seek medical care (OR = 1.92; 95% CI 1.39, 2.65 and OR = 3.73; 95% CI 2.56, 5.44, respectively). Nonetheless, parents tended to underestimate the boys\u2019 weight. Conclusion: Many parents do not accurately perceive their children\u2019s weight, height, and body shape. This misperception could influence their caring for children\u2019s health. Thus, educating parents about the perception of children\u2019s growth should be emphasized to avoid long-term health effects.",
