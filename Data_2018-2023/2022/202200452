Having reviewed theories on political parties and empirical research on finding the relation between the political and economic contexts, the political parties, and their organizations, the article finds that the policymaking process of political parties consists of: 1) centralization, 2) emphasis on solving everyday life\u2019s economy, 3) being consistent with state policy and plan, and 4) similarities with the policies of political parties with success in elections. According to analysis of political parties\u2019 policy structures and interviews with academicians and the informants from political parties, the article finds that the executive committee of political parties plays an enormous role in the policymaking process and concentrates on solving the problems of everyday life\u2019s economy for low-income people. Moreover, political parties are likely to make policies in accordance with the state plan and the Thai-Rak-Thai Party\u2019s policies. The implication is that the policymaking process of Thai political parties is vertically structured and rarely open to the rank-and-file to participate in. The participatory policymaking process becomes key to improving the quality of Thai democracy in the long run.",

Having reviewed theories on political parties and empirical research on finding the relation between the political and economic contexts, the political parties, and their organizations, the article finds that the policymaking process of political parties consists of: 1) centralization, 2) emphasis on solving everyday life\u2019s economy, 3) being consistent with state policy and plan, and 4) similarities with the policies of political parties with success in elections. According to analysis of political parties\u2019 policy structures and interviews with academicians and the informants from political parties, the article finds that the executive committee of political parties plays an enormous role in the policymaking process and concentrates on solving the problems of everyday life\u2019s economy for low-income people. Moreover, political parties are likely to make policies in accordance with the state plan and the Thai-Rak-Thai Party\u2019s policies. The implication is that the policymaking process of Thai political parties is vertically structured and rarely open to the rank-and-file to participate in. The participatory policymaking process becomes key to improving the quality of Thai democracy in the long run.",
