                "abstracts": "© 2021 Elsevier LtdThe white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has been considered a serious threat to shrimp aquaculture. Besides, the activation of cell metabolism as an immune reaction to the virus is now recognized as a piece of the pivotal puzzle of the antiviral responses. Hence, this study explores the relationship between metabolic gene expression and antiviral responses in shrimp using transcriptome analysis. The RNA-seq libraries of Fenneropenaeus merguensis hemocytes after WSSV challenge at early (6 hpi) and late (24 hpi) stages of infection were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that the WSSV subverted the expression. One-hundred-thirty-three DEGs that were expressed in response to WSSV infection at both stages were identified. Based on the GO annotation, they were related to innate immunity and metabolic pathway. The expression correlation between \u201cfull term\u201d (NGS) and qRT-PCR of 16 representative DEGs is shown. Noticeably, the expression profiles of all the selected metabolic genes involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism showed a specific correlation between NGS and qRT-PCR upon WSSV infection. Of these, we further characterized the function related to the WSSV response of glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (FmGFAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which was found to be up-regulated at the late stage of WSSV infection. Suppression of FmGFAT by RNA interference resulted in postponing the death of WSSV-infected shrimp and reduction of viral copy number. These results suggested that the FmGFAT is linked between metabolic change and WSSV responses in shrimp, where the virus-induced metabolic rewiring hijack biological compounds and/or energy sources to benefit the viral replication process.",

        "dc:description": "The white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has been considered a serious threat to shrimp aquaculture. Besides, the activation of cell metabolism as an immune reaction to the virus is now recognized as a piece of the pivotal puzzle of the antiviral responses. Hence, this study explores the relationship between metabolic gene expression and antiviral responses in shrimp using transcriptome analysis. The RNA-seq libraries of Fenneropenaeus merguensis hemocytes after WSSV challenge at early (6 hpi) and late (24 hpi) stages of infection were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that the WSSV subverted the expression. One-hundred-thirty-three DEGs that were expressed in response to WSSV infection at both stages were identified. Based on the GO annotation, they were related to innate immunity and metabolic pathway. The expression correlation between \u201cfull term\u201d (NGS) and qRT-PCR of 16 representative DEGs is shown. Noticeably, the expression profiles of all the selected metabolic genes involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism showed a specific correlation between NGS and qRT-PCR upon WSSV infection. Of these, we further characterized the function related to the WSSV response of glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase (FmGFAT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which was found to be up-regulated at the late stage of WSSV infection. Suppression of FmGFAT by RNA interference resulted in postponing the death of WSSV-infected shrimp and reduction of viral copy number. These results suggested that the FmGFAT is linked between metabolic change and WSSV responses in shrimp, where the virus-induced metabolic rewiring hijack biological compounds and/or energy sources to benefit the viral replication process.",
