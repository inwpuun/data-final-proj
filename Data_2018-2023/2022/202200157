                {"$": "Presently, we have formed a strong consortium among major arrhythmia centers in the universities of each region in Thailand: each region is fully set up to evaluate and treat BrS patients, including catheter ablation of Brugada substrates. This consortium with international collaboration also actively participates in ongoing research in the BRAVE randomized clinical trial, which is funded by National Research Council of Thailand and Biosense Webster, WGS, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for risk stratifications and genetic analysis. We also actively collaborate with industries like Biosense Webster and Medtronic to develop better tools to map and ablate epicardial substrate sites, hoping that we will be able to make the ablation procedure easier, less demanding, and more effective. Last, we believe that our experience can be share with other neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, and hopefully they too will be able to duplicate what we have done or even make it better for their countries. To this end, we are pleased to announce our team now plans to develop similar programs like ours in Hanoi, Vietnam, this year. If the program comes to fruition, many Vietnamese SUDS/BrS patients will greatly benefit from our work by not having to worry about VF or sudden death, and this makes our Brugada journey over the past 30 years so worthwhile!"},

Following this important observation, Brugada syndrome (BrS) became our main research focus and has galvanized our collaboration with several global prominent scientists over the past 30 years. Through this collaborative research, we made major progress toward better understanding of the syndrome and gained knowledge in genetic background, pathophysiology, and new management. Two consensus reports were published to help define diagnostic criteria, risk stratification, and management of BrS patients. In this review, we share our experiences and progress of our research and development of our program that was designed to identify the cause of sudden death, understand pathophysiology of the syndrome, and develop effective and safe management and therapy of BrS patients. Although our work in Thailand was challenging at the beginning, it later blossomed into a multicollaborative research enterprise that has produced several important findings that have shed light on the pathophysiology of BrS and development of a new effective treatment modality, catheter ablation.",

        "dc:description": "Our group began investigating the cause of sudden unexplained death syndrome in Thailand in 1994 and found that among sudden unexplained death syndrome patients, the Brugada phenotype was ubiquitous. Following this important observation, Brugada syndrome (BrS) became our main research focus and has galvanized our collaboration with several global prominent scientists over the past 30 years. Through this collaborative research, we made major progress toward better understanding of the syndrome and gained knowledge in genetic background, pathophysiology, and new management. Two consensus reports were published to help define diagnostic criteria, risk stratification, and management of BrS patients. In this review, we share our experiences and progress of our research and development of our program that was designed to identify the cause of sudden death, understand pathophysiology of the syndrome, and develop effective and safe management and therapy of BrS patients. Although our work in Thailand was challenging at the beginning, it later blossomed into a multicollaborative research enterprise that has produced several important findings that have shed light on the pathophysiology of BrS and development of a new effective treatment modality, catheter ablation.",
