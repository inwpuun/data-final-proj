Studies focusing on food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA) in Asian developing countries are limited. Our study aimed to study characteristics of FIA in a tertiary care center in an Asian developing country. Methods: Retrospective review of pediatric anaphylaxis admission and outpatient visit at a tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand during 2008-2018 was performed. Data regarding clinical presentation, place reaction occurred, time of onset, investigations (serum tryptase, specific immunoglobulin E, and skin test), treatment, and follow-up periods were collected. Results: One hundred seventy-four anaphylaxis admission records of which 61 episodes of FIA were retrieved. Data from outpatients visit consisted of 17 patients. Most patients were male (76.7%). The median age was 7.1 years (interquartile range 1.9-12.4). The major causes of FIA were shrimp/shellfish (37%), wheat (15.1%), and cow's milk (11%). Food causing anaphylaxis varied according to age-group: infants had anaphylactic reactions to egg, wheat, and cow's milk, preschools to wheat and peanut, and older children to shrimp/shellfish. Cutaneous manifestations occurred in all patients, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms (83.6%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50.8%). There was no biphasic anaphylaxis reported. Elevated serum tryptase was found in only 4 patients (7%). Conclusion: Recognizing characteristics of pediatric FIA is crucial. The common causes of FIA in our study in Asian children were egg in infants, wheat and peanut in preschool children, and shrimp/shellfish in school-age children and adolescents. Skin manifestation presented in all patients with FIA.",

Studies focusing on food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA) in Asian developing countries are limited. Our study aimed to study characteristics of FIA in a tertiary care center in an Asian developing country. Methods: Retrospective review of pediatric anaphylaxis admission and outpatient visit at a tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand during 2008-2018 was performed. Data regarding clinical presentation, place reaction occurred, time of onset, investigations (serum tryptase, specific immunoglobulin E, and skin test), treatment, and follow-up periods were collected. Results: One hundred seventy-four anaphylaxis admission records of which 61 episodes of FIA were retrieved. Data from outpatients visit consisted of 17 patients. Most patients were male (76.7%). The median age was 7.1 years (interquartile range 1.9-12.4). The major causes of FIA were shrimp/shellfish (37%), wheat (15.1%), and cow's milk (11%). Food causing anaphylaxis varied according to age-group: infants had anaphylactic reactions to egg, wheat, and cow's milk, preschools to wheat and peanut, and older children to shrimp/shellfish. Cutaneous manifestations occurred in all patients, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms (83.6%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50.8%). There was no biphasic anaphylaxis reported. Elevated serum tryptase was found in only 4 patients (7%). Conclusion: Recognizing characteristics of pediatric FIA is crucial. The common causes of FIA in our study in Asian children were egg in infants, wheat and peanut in preschool children, and shrimp/shellfish in school-age children and adolescents. Skin manifestation presented in all patients with FIA.",
