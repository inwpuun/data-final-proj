All rights reserved.Hyposalivation and severe dry mouth syndrome are the most common complications in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) after receiving radiation therapy. Conventional treatment for hyposalivation relies on the use of sialogogues such as pilocarpine; however, their efficacy is constrained by the limited number of remnant acinar cells after radiation. After radiotherapy, the salivary gland (SG) secretory parenchyma is largely destroyed, and due to the reduced stem cell niche, this gland has poor regenerative potential.

MSC-like cells like human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC) have been tested in novel magnetic bioprinting platforms using nanoparticles that can bind cell membranes by electrostatic interaction, as well as their paracrine signals arising from extracellular vesicles. Both magnetized cells and their secretome cues were found to increase epithelial and neuronal growth of in vitro and ex vivo irradiated SG models. Interestingly, these magnetic bioprinting platforms can be applied as a high-throughput drug screening system due to the consistency in structure and functions of their organoids. Recently, exogenous decellularized porcine ECM was added to this magnetic platform to stimulate an ideal environment for cell tethering, proliferation, and/or differentiation. The combination of these SG tissue biofabrication strategies will promptly allow for in vitro organoid formation and establishment of cellular senescent organoids for aging models, but challenges remain in terms of epithelial polarization and lumen formation for unidirectional fluid flow.
