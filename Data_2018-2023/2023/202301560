                "abstracts": "© 2022 British Endodontic Society. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim: Tideglusib is a small molecule agonist of the canonical Wnt pathway. The present study investigated the influence of Tideglusib on human dental pulp stem cell (hDPSC) proliferation, apoptosis, migration and odonto/osteogenic differentiation. Methodology: hDPSCs were treated with 50, 100 nM or 200 nM Tideglusib. β-catenin accumulation was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Colony-forming unit ability was assessed by staining with Coomassie blue. Cell cycle progression and cell apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Cell migration was examined using an in vitro wound-healing assay. Osteogenic differentiation was examined using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red S staining and osteogenic-related gene expression. The gene expression profile was examined using a high-throughput RNA sequencing technique. All experiments were repeated using cells derived from at least four different donors (n = 4). The Mann\u2013Whitney U-test was used to identify significant differences between two independent group comparisons. For three or more group comparisons, statistical differences were assessed using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by pairwise comparison. The significance level was set at 5% (p <.05). Results: Tideglusib activated the Wnt signalling pathway in hDPSCs as demonstrated by an increase in cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. Tideglusib did not affect hDPSC proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis or cell migration. In contrast, 50 and 100 nM Tideglusib significantly enhanced mineralization and osteogenic marker gene expression (RUNX2, ALP, BMP2 and DSPP; p <.05). Conclusions: Tideglusib enhanced the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. Therefore, incorporating this bioactive molecule in a pulp-capping material could be a promising strategy to promote dentine repair.",

        "dc:description": "Aim: Tideglusib is a small molecule agonist of the canonical Wnt pathway. The present study investigated the influence of Tideglusib on human dental pulp stem cell (hDPSC) proliferation, apoptosis, migration and odonto/osteogenic differentiation. Methodology: hDPSCs were treated with 50, 100 nM or 200 nM Tideglusib. β-catenin accumulation was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Colony-forming unit ability was assessed by staining with Coomassie blue. Cell cycle progression and cell apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Cell migration was examined using an in vitro wound-healing assay. Osteogenic differentiation was examined using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red S staining and osteogenic-related gene expression. The gene expression profile was examined using a high-throughput RNA sequencing technique. All experiments were repeated using cells derived from at least four different donors (n = 4). The Mann\u2013Whitney U-test was used to identify significant differences between two independent group comparisons. For three or more group comparisons, statistical differences were assessed using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by pairwise comparison. The significance level was set at 5% (p <.05). Results: Tideglusib activated the Wnt signalling pathway in hDPSCs as demonstrated by an increase in cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation. Tideglusib did not affect hDPSC proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis or cell migration. In contrast, 50 and 100 nM Tideglusib significantly enhanced mineralization and osteogenic marker gene expression (RUNX2, ALP, BMP2 and DSPP; p <.05). Conclusions: Tideglusib enhanced the odonto/osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. Therefore, incorporating this bioactive molecule in a pulp-capping material could be a promising strategy to promote dentine repair.",
