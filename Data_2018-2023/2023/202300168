                "abstracts": "© 2023, The Author(s).Background: Postpartum sterilization in Thailand has relatively few barriers compared to other countries. The procedure is covered by some healthcare plans, and paid out-of-pocket for others. We aim to determine if healthcare coverage and other socioeconomic factors affect the rate of postpartum sterilization in an urban, tertiary hospital. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort of 4482 postpartum women who delivered at our hospital. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine if sterilization reimbursement affects immediate postpartum sterilization rate. Results: Overall immediate postpartum sterilization rate was 17.8%. Route of delivery and parity were similar in those who were reimbursed and those who were not. Women aged over 25 were more likely to have a healthcare plan that does not cover postpartum sterilization. Women whose healthcare plan reimbursed the procedure trended towards postpartum sterilization when compared to women who were not (aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86\u20131.28, p-value = 0.632). Women who delivered via cesarean section were more likely to undergo sterilization at the time of delivery (aOR = 5.87; 95% CI 4.77\u20137.24, p-value = < 0.001). Women aged 40\u201344 years were 2.70 times as likely to choose sterilization than those aged 20\u201324 years (aOR = 2.70; 95% CI 1.61\u20134.53, p-value < 0.001). Conclusions: Healthcare coverage of the procedure was not associated with increased postpartum sterilization in our setting.",

The procedure is covered by some healthcare plans, and paid out-of-pocket for others. We aim to determine if healthcare coverage and other socioeconomic factors affect the rate of postpartum sterilization in an urban, tertiary hospital. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a retrospective cohort of 4482 postpartum women who delivered at our hospital. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine if sterilization reimbursement affects immediate postpartum sterilization rate. Results: Overall immediate postpartum sterilization rate was 17.8%. Route of delivery and parity were similar in those who were reimbursed and those who were not. Women aged over 25 were more likely to have a healthcare plan that does not cover postpartum sterilization. Women whose healthcare plan reimbursed the procedure trended towards postpartum sterilization when compared to women who were not (aOR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86\u20131.28, p-value = 0.632). Women who delivered via cesarean section were more likely to undergo sterilization at the time of delivery (aOR = 5.87; 95% CI 4.77\u20137.24, p-value = < 0.001). Women aged 40\u201344 years were 2.70 times as likely to choose sterilization than those aged 20\u201324 years (aOR = 2.70; 95% CI 1.61\u20134.53, p-value < 0.001). Conclusions: Healthcare coverage of the procedure was not associated with increased postpartum sterilization in our setting.",
