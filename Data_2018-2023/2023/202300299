                "abstracts": "© 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.This study demonstrates the 3D visualization of the lamina cribrosa (LC) structure and its correlation with volumetric data, pore volume, and disc area in glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes. The participant cohort included 65 glaucomatous and 58 non-glaucomatous eyes (13 suspected glaucoma and 45 normal). An ophthalmologist diagnosed glaucoma patients and all subjects were over 18 years old, passed a visual field test, and underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations. LC images were obtained using the DRI OCT Triton, while optic disc images were obtained from the enface image of the Cirrus HD-OCT 5000. Since LC images alone did not provide clear edge information, we used optic disc images as a reference for edge detection. To achieve this, we employed a fine-tuned model, specifically a pre-trained U-shaped Encoder-Decoder Network with Attention. This model was used to obtain a segmented mask, which was then aligned and utilized to locate the edge of the LC in the LC images. A blood vessel mask was created to remove blood vessels, as they can interfere with the accurate visualization and analysis of LC characteristics. This step allowed for the 3D reconstruction of the LC structure without the presence of blood vessels. Correlations between LC volume, pore volume, and pore volume to LC volume were calculated separately for glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous eyes. We divided the areas for considering the LC structure into three types: overall, quadrants, and 12-clock-hour sectors. Based on the experimental results, we found that the pore volume and pore-to-LC volume were different between glaucoma and normal across all areas considered. In conclusion, this research generated 3D images of the LC from OCT images using computer techniques, showcasing a microstructure that closely resembles the actual LC. Statistical methods were employed to calculate and analyze the differences observed between the two groups of samples.",

        "dc:description": "This study demonstrates the 3D visualization of the lamina cribrosa (LC) structure and its correlation with volumetric data, pore volume, and disc area in glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes. The participant cohort included 65 glaucomatous and 58 non-glaucomatous eyes (13 suspected glaucoma and 45 normal). An ophthalmologist diagnosed glaucoma patients and all subjects were over 18 years old, passed a visual field test, and underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) examinations. LC images were obtained using the DRI OCT Triton, while optic disc images were obtained from the enface image of the Cirrus HD-OCT 5000. Since LC images alone did not provide clear edge information, we used optic disc images as a reference for edge detection. To achieve this, we employed a fine-tuned model, specifically a pre-trained U-shaped Encoder-Decoder Network with Attention. This model was used to obtain a segmented mask, which was then aligned and utilized to locate the edge of the LC in the LC images. A blood vessel mask was created to remove blood vessels, as they can interfere with the accurate visualization and analysis of LC characteristics. This step allowed for the 3D reconstruction of the LC structure without the presence of blood vessels. Correlations between LC volume, pore volume, and pore volume to LC volume were calculated separately for glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous eyes. We divided the areas for considering the LC structure into three types: overall, quadrants, and 12-clock-hour sectors. Based on the experimental results, we found that the pore volume and pore-to-LC volume were different between glaucoma and normal across all areas considered. In conclusion, this research generated 3D images of the LC from OCT images using computer techniques, showcasing a microstructure that closely resembles the actual LC. Statistical methods were employed to calculate and analyze the differences observed between the two groups of samples.",
