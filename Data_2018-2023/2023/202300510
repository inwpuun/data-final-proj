                "abstracts": "© 2023 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents the full analysis of near-interface cracks in three-dimensional linear elastic multimaterial bodies by a weakly singular boundary integral equation method (BIEM). The proposed technique was implemented in a general framework that allowed the treatment of finite cracked bodies with general configurations, material anisotropy, and mode-mixity. A system of integral equations governing unknown data on the boundary, crack surface, and material interface was established using a pair of weakly singular weak-form displacement and traction integral equations together with continuity along the material interface. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method along with the finite element technique were implemented to solve the governing integral equations. In addition, the special near-front interpolation was employed to enhance the approximation of the relative crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack front. The solved crack-face data were used directly to post-process the stress intensity factors and T-stresses along the crack front. An extensive numerical study was carried out not only to demonstrate the accuracy, convergence, and capability of the proposed technique, but also to explore the influence of material stiffness and distance to the material interface on fracture data along the crack front.",

        "dc:description": "This paper presents the full analysis of near-interface cracks in three-dimensional linear elastic multimaterial bodies by a weakly singular boundary integral equation method (BIEM). The proposed technique was implemented in a general framework that allowed the treatment of finite cracked bodies with general configurations, material anisotropy, and mode-mixity. A system of integral equations governing unknown data on the boundary, crack surface, and material interface was established using a pair of weakly singular weak-form displacement and traction integral equations together with continuity along the material interface. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method along with the finite element technique were implemented to solve the governing integral equations. In addition, the special near-front interpolation was employed to enhance the approximation of the relative crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack front. The solved crack-face data were used directly to post-process the stress intensity factors and T-stresses along the crack front. An extensive numerical study was carried out not only to demonstrate the accuracy, convergence, and capability of the proposed technique, but also to explore the influence of material stiffness and distance to the material interface on fracture data along the crack front.",
