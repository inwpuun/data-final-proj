                "abstracts": "© 2023, The Author(s).Background: Tricalcium silicate is the main component of commercial bioceramic cements that are widely used in endodontic treatment. Calcium carbonate, which is manufactured from limestone, is one of the substrates of tricalcium silicate. To avoid the environmental impact of mining, calcium carbonate can be obtained from biological sources, such as shelled mollusks, one of which is cockle shell. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the chemical, physical, and biological properties of a newly developed bioceramic cement derived from cockle shell (BioCement) with those of a commercial tricalcium silicate cement (Biodentine). Methods: BioCement was prepared from cockle shells and rice husk ash and its chemical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The physical properties were evaluated following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9917-1;2007 and 6876;2012. The pH was tested after 3 h to 8 weeks. The biological properties were assessed using extraction medium from BioCement and Biodentine on human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) in vitro. The 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide assay was used to evaluate cell cytotoxicity following ISO 10993-5;2009. Cell migration was examined using a wound healing assay. Alizarin red staining was performed to detect osteogenic differentiation. The data were tested for a normal distribution. Once confirmed, the physical properties and pH data were analyzed using the independent t-test, and the biological property data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. Results: The main components of BioCement and Biodentine were calcium and silicon. BioCement\u2019s and Biodentine\u2019s setting time and compressive strength were not different. The radiopacity of BioCement and Biodentine was 5.00 and 3.92 mmAl, respectively (p < 0.05). BioCement\u2019s solubility was significantly higher than Biodentine. Both materials exhibited alkalinity (pH ranged from 9 to 12) and demonstrated > 90% cell viability with cell proliferation. The highest mineralization was found in the BioCement group at 7 days (p < 0.05). Conclusions: BioCement exhibited acceptable chemical and physical properties and was biocompatible to human dental pulp cells. BioCement promotes pulp cell migration and osteogenic differentiation.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Tricalcium silicate is the main component of commercial bioceramic cements that are widely used in endodontic treatment. Calcium carbonate, which is manufactured from limestone, is one of the substrates of tricalcium silicate. To avoid the environmental impact of mining, calcium carbonate can be obtained from biological sources, such as shelled mollusks, one of which is cockle shell. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the chemical, physical, and biological properties of a newly developed bioceramic cement derived from cockle shell (BioCement) with those of a commercial tricalcium silicate cement (Biodentine). Methods: BioCement was prepared from cockle shells and rice husk ash and its chemical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The physical properties were evaluated following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9917-1;2007 and 6876;2012. The pH was tested after 3 h to 8 weeks. The biological properties were assessed using extraction medium from BioCement and Biodentine on human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) in vitro. The 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2 H-tetrazolium hydroxide assay was used to evaluate cell cytotoxicity following ISO 10993-5;2009. Cell migration was examined using a wound healing assay. Alizarin red staining was performed to detect osteogenic differentiation. The data were tested for a normal distribution. Once confirmed, the physical properties and pH data were analyzed using the independent t-test, and the biological property data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. Results: The main components of BioCement and Biodentine were calcium and silicon. BioCement\u2019s and Biodentine\u2019s setting time and compressive strength were not different. The radiopacity of BioCement and Biodentine was 5.00 and 3.92 mmAl, respectively (p < 0.05). BioCement\u2019s solubility was significantly higher than Biodentine. Both materials exhibited alkalinity (pH ranged from 9 to 12) and demonstrated > 90% cell viability with cell proliferation. The highest mineralization was found in the BioCement group at 7 days (p < 0.05). Conclusions: BioCement exhibited acceptable chemical and physical properties and was biocompatible to human dental pulp cells. BioCement promotes pulp cell migration and osteogenic differentiation.",
