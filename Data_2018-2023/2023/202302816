Historically, Southeast Asian regional academic networks have evolved and diversified as specialized organizations or membership bodies alongside regional intergovernmental institutions such as ASEAN founded in 1967 and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) in 1965. SEAMEO spawned various specialized agencies including the Southeast Asia Ministers of Education Organization, Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEAMEO-SEARCA) established in 1966. SEARCA itself facilitated specialized sub-networks such as the Southeast Asian University Consortium for Graduate Education in Agriculture and Natural Resources (SEAUC) established in 1989 with members within and outside the region. The ASEAN University Network (AUN) founded in 1995 is also a prominent example of a mainstream regional academic network. But the AUN, well funded by Member States, HEIs and external donors, has an exclusive membership of mostly large elite universities. It has sometimes addressed agriculture or food themes in projects or meetings but not as a priority."},

Beginning in 2015 the network complemented global higher education responses to SDGs, IPCC Reports, ASEAN work-plans, FAO\u2019s scaling-up agroecology initiative, UNESCO sustainability programming and more. University partners, farmer groups, research institutes, NGOs, regional organizations, governments, international agencies, and donors collaborated. This new Southeast Asian academic network was an innovation to address perceived gaps in other academic networks, alliances, or intergovernmental and non-government membership organizations. It facilitated cross-sectoral cooperation and transdisciplinary discussions with representatives of both specialized or mandated national agriculture colleges or universities as well as multi-purpose universities with agri-food faculties or schools. The network lost some momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic but FAO collaborating with SEAMEO-SEARCA and others initiated some follow-up online. Nonetheless, the initiative remains an unfinished experiment in regional network-building and academic reform. The paper contributes to literatures on higher education sustainability, regional learning, sustainable agri-food systems, and agroecological transitions while critically analyzing network aspirations, outputs, outcomes, and future research needs.",

        "dc:description": "This paper discusses a regional academic network-building initiative that advocated university reforms to promote sustainable agriculture in Southeast Asia, and strengthen agroecological/agri-food systems knowledge in campus policies, research, curricula, and extension. Beginning in 2015 the network complemented global higher education responses to SDGs, IPCC Reports, ASEAN work-plans, FAO\u2019s scaling-up agroecology initiative, UNESCO sustainability programming and more. University partners, farmer groups, research institutes, NGOs, regional organizations, governments, international agencies, and donors collaborated. This new Southeast Asian academic network was an innovation to address perceived gaps in other academic networks, alliances, or intergovernmental and non-government membership organizations. It facilitated cross-sectoral cooperation and transdisciplinary discussions with representatives of both specialized or mandated national agriculture colleges or universities as well as multi-purpose universities with agri-food faculties or schools. The network lost some momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic but FAO collaborating with SEAMEO-SEARCA and others initiated some follow-up online. Nonetheless, the initiative remains an unfinished experiment in regional network-building and academic reform. The paper contributes to literatures on higher education sustainability, regional learning, sustainable agri-food systems, and agroecological transitions while critically analyzing network aspirations, outputs, outcomes, and future research needs.",
