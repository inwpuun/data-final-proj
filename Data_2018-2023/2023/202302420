The said problems had to do with the inability to manage assignments during weekdays, the struggle to understand core subject terminology, financial concerns arising from hefty tuition hikes, and test anxiety due to a lack of time management skill. To solve these aforementioned problems, the participants resorted to the following strategies: Those who lacked time management skill found themselves became increasing stressful in the classroom situation where everyone seemed to excel very fast and was competitive when it came to learning. Still, they knew they were friends. They helped each other by talking to one another. Once they found an outlet to talk and discuss their problems and frustration, they became more organized to meet their deadlines, project due dates and know how to study for examination. The students who came across a financial concern arising from a hefty tuition hike found a solution by taking a scholarship opportunity and received partial funding.",

All rights reserved.The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of Thai primary school students who have studied in an English Program (EP) in a university demonstration school in Thailand. EP is regarded as one of Thailand\u2019s educational reform goals that will enhance Thai students\u2019 English competency through using English as a tool of instruction for teaching and learning in two core subjects, Science and Maths. The program started in primary level and continued to secondary level. A phenomenological methodology was employed to explore the students\u2019 lived experiences (n = 10). Semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and document analysis were used for data collection. The data was analyzed using Moustakas (1994)\u2019s phenomenological analysis steps. The findings revealed the essence of the phenomenon. That is, studying in English Program (EP) entailed nine themes under four dimensions as follows: Academic Dimension; Social Dimension; Emotional Dimension, and Personal Dimension. Some implications are discussed concerning the appropriate EP program policy and the inclusion of the voices of teachers and school administrators. Some limitations are also mentioned.",

EP is regarded as one of Thailand\u2019s educational reform goals that will enhance Thai students\u2019 English competency through using English as a tool of instruction for teaching and learning in two core subjects, Science and Maths. The program started in primary level and continued to secondary level. A phenomenological methodology was employed to explore the students\u2019 lived experiences (n = 10). Semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and document analysis were used for data collection. The data was analyzed using Moustakas (1994)\u2019s phenomenological analysis steps. The findings revealed the essence of the phenomenon. That is, studying in English Program (EP) entailed nine themes under four dimensions as follows: Academic Dimension; Social Dimension; Emotional Dimension, and Personal Dimension. Some implications are discussed concerning the appropriate EP program policy and the inclusion of the voices of teachers and school administrators. Some limitations are also mentioned.",
