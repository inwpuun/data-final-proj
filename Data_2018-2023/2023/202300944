                "abstracts": "© 2023 Elsevier LtdThe Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (KuSPI) is a low molecular weight protein that plays a role in modulating a range of biological processes. In Penaeus monodon, the PmKuSPI gene has been found to be highly expressed in the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-infected shrimp and is predicted to be regulated by a conserved microRNA, pmo-miR-bantam. We reported that, despite being upregulated at the transcriptional level, the PmKuSPI protein was also upregulated after WSSV infection. Silencing the PmKuSPI gene in healthy shrimp had no effect on phenoloxidase activity or apoptosis but resulted in a delay in the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp as well as a reduction in the total hemocyte number and WSSV copies. According to an in vitro luciferase reporter assay, the pmo-miR-bantam bound to the 3\u2032UTR of the PmKuSPI gene as predicted. In accordance with the loss of function studies using dsRNA-mediated RNA interference, the administration of the pmo-miR-bantam mimic into WSSV-infected shrimp lowered the expression of the PmKuSPI transcript and the PmKuSPI protein, as well as the WSSV copy number. According to these results, the protease inhibitor PmKuSPI is posttranscriptionally controlled by pmo-miR-bantam and plays a role in hemocyte homeostasis, which in turn affects shrimp susceptibility to WSSV infection.",

        "dc:description": "The Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (KuSPI) is a low molecular weight protein that plays a role in modulating a range of biological processes. In Penaeus monodon, the PmKuSPI gene has been found to be highly expressed in the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-infected shrimp and is predicted to be regulated by a conserved microRNA, pmo-miR-bantam. We reported that, despite being upregulated at the transcriptional level, the PmKuSPI protein was also upregulated after WSSV infection. Silencing the PmKuSPI gene in healthy shrimp had no effect on phenoloxidase activity or apoptosis but resulted in a delay in the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp as well as a reduction in the total hemocyte number and WSSV copies. According to an in vitro luciferase reporter assay, the pmo-miR-bantam bound to the 3\u2032UTR of the PmKuSPI gene as predicted. In accordance with the loss of function studies using dsRNA-mediated RNA interference, the administration of the pmo-miR-bantam mimic into WSSV-infected shrimp lowered the expression of the PmKuSPI transcript and the PmKuSPI protein, as well as the WSSV copy number. According to these results, the protease inhibitor PmKuSPI is posttranscriptionally controlled by pmo-miR-bantam and plays a role in hemocyte homeostasis, which in turn affects shrimp susceptibility to WSSV infection.",
