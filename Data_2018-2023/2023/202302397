Whether the Anthropocene began with the process of agricultural expansion some 7,000 or 8,000 years ago, or with the industrial revolution of the 18th centrury, China\u2019s ecological footprint has been visible in this global process of human ecosystem domination. More so over the past 30 years, when China accelerated its speed of economic development by rapidly increasing control and technological mastery of nature. Viewed on the one hand as an achievement, China\u2019s inventiveness to push back the limits of nature and replace ecosystems function by human technology has not gone unchallenged. Drawing from perspectives on the Anthropocene as the climate and ecological crisis it examines human\u2013honeybee interactions from China\u2019s past civilization up to the present time of global honey trade. It discusses the importance of a paradigm shift for China to become a redeeming agent \u2013 when China embraces the epochal consciousness and recognize the two complimenting conceptions of human \u2013 as a cultural and social being and as a biological species \u2013 to redefine their relations with honeybees, and realize that the fate of one determines that of the other.",

Whether the Anthropocene began with the process of agricultural expansion some 7,000 or 8,000 years ago, or with the industrial revolution of the 18th centrury, China\u2019s ecological footprint has been visible in this global process of human ecosystem domination. More so over the past 30 years, when China accelerated its speed of economic development by rapidly increasing control and technological mastery of nature. Viewed on the one hand as an achievement, China\u2019s inventiveness to push back the limits of nature and replace ecosystems function by human technology has not gone unchallenged. Drawing from perspectives on the Anthropocene as the climate and ecological crisis it examines human\u2013honeybee interactions from China\u2019s past civilization up to the present time of global honey trade. It discusses the importance of a paradigm shift for China to become a redeeming agent \u2013 when China embraces the epochal consciousness and recognize the two complimenting conceptions of human \u2013 as a cultural and social being and as a biological species \u2013 to redefine their relations with honeybees, and realize that the fate of one determines that of the other.",
