Environmental factors have a crucial role in the formation of soil microbial communities. The rhizosphere bacteria influence soil function through driving biogeochemical processes, regulating nutrient and organic matter composition, and performing environmental functions. This book is divided into nine chapters that explain various aspects of the rhizosphere. Chapter One focuses on the rhizosphere: microbial community structure and plant-microbe ecology. Chapter Two aims to show the rhizosphere microbiome: a fascination of microbial community. Chapter Three presents the distribution of proteobacteria in rhizosphere and their plant beneficial Interactions. Chapter Four presents plant growth promoting traits of acetic acid bacteria associated with the root endosphere and rhizosphere. Chapter Five is aimed at the rhizobia genome: diversity, evolution and function. Chapter Six presents the neighborhood of arbuscular mycorrhiza: plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and rhizobia. Chapter Seven reviews the diversity of actinobacteria in the rhizosphere and their biotechnological applications. Chapter Eight focuses on spore-forming bacteria in rhizosphere, its distribution and applications. Lastly, Chapter Nine presents the diversity and application of yeasts in the rhizosphere.",
