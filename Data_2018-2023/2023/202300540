                "abstracts": "© 2023 The Authors. Cancer Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Background: The survival rate of adult patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) depends on the responses to standard chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or combined therapy. Resource-limited countries face numerous obstacles in supporting patients with HL who undergo chemotherapy, especially in advanced stages. Aim: To analyze the survival outcomes of adult patients with HL after combined-modality treatment (CMT) with involved-field or non-involved-field radiotherapy. Methods and Results: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 90 adult patients with HL who received CMT at Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok between 2007 and 2021. Patients with stage I-IV disease received different therapies depending on their risk group. The risk groups were evaluated according to initial response, bulky disease, and B symptoms. Patients (n = 90) who underwent CMT were followed up for 34.7 months (range, 1\u2013141 months). The median follow-up periods of early and advanced-stage patients were 53.1 months and 23.5 months, respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates of patients with advanced-stage diseases were 85% and 62%, respectively. There was a difference in the 3-year overall survival among advance-stage patients who underwent ABVD (94%) compared to those administered BEACOPPesc (50%), and the 3-year PFS (84%) among patients who underwent ABVD was higher than that among those administered BEACOPPesc (66%). Radiotherapy increased toxicity but did not improve the survival rate. Conclusion: Chemotherapy administered to patients with advanced-stage adult HL was more effective than BEACOPPesc when ABVD was administered. Our findings are relevant for hospitals with limited resources.",

Resource-limited countries face numerous obstacles in supporting patients with HL who undergo chemotherapy, especially in advanced stages. Aim: To analyze the survival outcomes of adult patients with HL after combined-modality treatment (CMT) with involved-field or non-involved-field radiotherapy. Methods and Results: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 90 adult patients with HL who received CMT at Rajavithi Hospital, Bangkok between 2007 and 2021. Patients with stage I-IV disease received different therapies depending on their risk group. The risk groups were evaluated according to initial response, bulky disease, and B symptoms. Patients (n = 90) who underwent CMT were followed up for 34.7 months (range, 1\u2013141 months). The median follow-up periods of early and advanced-stage patients were 53.1 months and 23.5 months, respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates of patients with advanced-stage diseases were 85% and 62%, respectively. There was a difference in the 3-year overall survival among advance-stage patients who underwent ABVD (94%) compared to those administered BEACOPPesc (50%), and the 3-year PFS (84%) among patients who underwent ABVD was higher than that among those administered BEACOPPesc (66%). Radiotherapy increased toxicity but did not improve the survival rate. Conclusion: Chemotherapy administered to patients with advanced-stage adult HL was more effective than BEACOPPesc when ABVD was administered. Our findings are relevant for hospitals with limited resources.",
