Next, a list of global associations working on automation, control, and robotics is presented in Sect. 74.2. Thereafter, Sect. 74.3 provides automation and robotics laboratories around the world, and, finally, a list of automation and robotics journals and publications is presented in Sect. 74.4. A window into the current and evolving state of automation is opened by the statistics, organizations, and journals included in this chapter. While attempting to be comprehensive, the authors recognize that there may be additional relevant items due to the breadth of automation, but none was deliberately omitted. The knowledge scope in this handbook aims to illustrate the wide variety, applications, benefits, and challenges of automation, and obviously, not all areas of automation impact can be fully included. Beyond this, the rest of the chapters include additional statistical data specifically related to the corresponding topic.",

Next, a list of global associations working on automation, control, and robotics is presented in Sect. 74.2. Thereafter, Sect. 74.3 provides automation and robotics laboratories around the world, and, finally, a list of automation and robotics journals and publications is presented in Sect. 74.4. A window into the current and evolving state of automation is opened by the statistics, organizations, and journals included in this chapter. While attempting to be comprehensive, the authors recognize that there may be additional relevant items due to the breadth of automation, but none was deliberately omitted. The knowledge scope in this handbook aims to illustrate the wide variety, applications, benefits, and challenges of automation, and obviously, not all areas of automation impact can be fully included. Beyond this, the rest of the chapters include additional statistical data specifically related to the corresponding topic.",
