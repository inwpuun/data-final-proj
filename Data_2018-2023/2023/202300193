                "abstracts": "© 2023 The AuthorsArtificial reefs are being utilised globally to aid in natural resource management, conservation, restoration or the creation of unique marine habitats. There is discussion around the optimal construction materials and designs for artificial reefs, the influences these have on biological communities, and the resulting ecological and social benefits. This discussion also includes the ecological value of repurposed marine infrastructure, such as decommissioned oil and gas platforms. Platforms often have an operational life spanning multiple decades, over which time they can develop extensive and unique community assemblages. The creation of artificial reefs by repurposing oil and gas platforms can have ecological, economic and sociological merit. However, with >12,000 platforms requiring decommissioning globally, there is the need for holistic assessment of biological communities associated with these platforms to inform the potential outcomes of different decommissioning options. We use environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) of water, bio-foul and sediment samples to census broad eukaryotic diversity at eight platforms in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT) and five nearby soft sediment habitat locations. We sampled three target depths at sites (shallow, mid, deep) and detected 430 taxa at platforms, with higher diversity in shallow (near-surface) samples (313 taxa), compared to mid (30 m collection depth; 261 taxa) and deep (50 m; 273 taxa). Three percent of taxa were shared among all depths at platforms with distinct assembles at each depth. Introduced species are an ongoing risk for platforms, however the eDNA detected no known introduced species. While the eDNA data provide broad taxon coverage and significant assemblage patterns, ongoing sampling innovation, assay design and local reference material still require development to obtain the maximum benefit of the technique. This study highlights the versatility and scalability of eDNA metabarcoding to holistically census marine infrastructure and inform the management and potential conservation of extant communities.",

        "dc:description": "Artificial reefs are being utilised globally to aid in natural resource management, conservation, restoration or the creation of unique marine habitats. There is discussion around the optimal construction materials and designs for artificial reefs, the influences these have on biological communities, and the resulting ecological and social benefits. This discussion also includes the ecological value of repurposed marine infrastructure, such as decommissioned oil and gas platforms. Platforms often have an operational life spanning multiple decades, over which time they can develop extensive and unique community assemblages. The creation of artificial reefs by repurposing oil and gas platforms can have ecological, economic and sociological merit. However, with >12,000 platforms requiring decommissioning globally, there is the need for holistic assessment of biological communities associated with these platforms to inform the potential outcomes of different decommissioning options. We use environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) of water, bio-foul and sediment samples to census broad eukaryotic diversity at eight platforms in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT) and five nearby soft sediment habitat locations. We sampled three target depths at sites (shallow, mid, deep) and detected 430 taxa at platforms, with higher diversity in shallow (near-surface) samples (313 taxa), compared to mid (30 m collection depth; 261 taxa) and deep (50 m; 273 taxa). Three percent of taxa were shared among all depths at platforms with distinct assembles at each depth. Introduced species are an ongoing risk for platforms, however the eDNA detected no known introduced species. While the eDNA data provide broad taxon coverage and significant assemblage patterns, ongoing sampling innovation, assay design and local reference material still require development to obtain the maximum benefit of the technique. This study highlights the versatility and scalability of eDNA metabarcoding to holistically census marine infrastructure and inform the management and potential conservation of extant communities.",
