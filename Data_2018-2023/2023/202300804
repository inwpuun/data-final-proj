                {"$": "In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic [27] and proposed policies and regulations to support healthcare systems across the world. At present, 196 countries, including the 194 member states of WHO, have adopted the 2005 International Health Regulation (IHR) [28]. The IHR is intended to prevent and protect public health from the spread of disease [29]. The IHR is the primary regulation, and numerous frameworks and regulations have been created for it to comply with the IHR. The IHR also provides an index for countries to self-assess whether they can fully apply the IHR, termed the IHR State Party Self-Assessment Annual Report (SPAR) [30]. The SPAR index describes how well a given country can handle the risk of infectious disease disasters. Razavi et al. used the SPAR index as a primary key in defining the core capacities to deal with the COVID-19 situation [31]. Some research, such as the study of Satria et al. [32], also mentioned that the capacity of SPAR could potentially mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and even the future pandemic.WHO also created an index for assessing the fundamentals of health service delivery for each country called the universal health coverage (UHC) score. The UHC was created to support WHO in its provision of equal health access for all people [33] and as indicator 3.8.1 \u201cCoverage of essential health services\u201d for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [34], Several studies have sought to prove that a country with high-value UHC scores will have a superior performance in dealing with the COVID-19 situation [35,36].This research project is supported by the Thailand Science research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University (DIS66210025), Thailand; the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; and the UCL-Tohoku University Strategic Partner Funds and a COVID-19-related research support project (IRIDeS), Japan."},

                "abstracts": "© 2023 The AuthorsThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a continual challenge since 2020, and it continues to impact people and industries as a disaster caused by a biological hazard. This study examined universal health coverage (UHC) scores in relation to the performance in combating COVID-19 in the Southeast Asian region (SEAR) and the Western Pacific region (WPR), along with the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) index under the international health regulations (IHC). The numbers of infections and deaths per million population from December 2019 to June 2022 were used as primary outcomes to measure countries\u2019 performance. Countries with UHC scores of 63 or higher had a significantly lower number of infected patients and deaths. In addition, several inter-capacity correlations within the SPAR capacities, including with C8 (the National Health Emergency Framework), as well as a very strong correlation to C4 (Food Safety), C5 (Laboratory), and C7 (Human Resources). Furthermore, C9 (Health Service Provisions) has a very strong correlation to C1 (Legislation and Financing), C2 (International Health Regulation Coordination and a National IHR Focal Point function), and C4 (Food Safety), suggesting that the capability to manage an emerging infectious disease form blocks of capacities. In conclusion, UHC clearly mitigated the health-related consequences of COVID-19 in South-East Asia Region (SEAR) and Western Pacific Region (WPR). Investigating the correlation between the SPAR capacities and UHC is a promising approach for future research, including the importance of the provision of health services, points of entry, and, most importantly, risk communications as critical factors for managing pandemic. This study constitutes a good opportunity to apply the SPAR index to define which capacities correlate with the outcome of the pandemic in terms of infections and deaths.",

At present, 196 countries, including the 194 member states of WHO, have adopted the 2005 International Health Regulation (IHR) [28]. The IHR is intended to prevent and protect public health from the spread of disease [29]. The IHR is the primary regulation, and numerous frameworks and regulations have been created for it to comply with the IHR. The IHR also provides an index for countries to self-assess whether they can fully apply the IHR, termed the IHR State Party Self-Assessment Annual Report (SPAR) [30]. The SPAR index describes how well a given country can handle the risk of infectious disease disasters. Razavi et al. used the SPAR index as a primary key in defining the core capacities to deal with the COVID-19 situation [31]. Some research, such as the study of Satria et al. [32], also mentioned that the capacity of SPAR could potentially mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and even the future pandemic.WHO also created an index for assessing the fundamentals of health service delivery for each country called the universal health coverage (UHC) score. The UHC was created to support WHO in its provision of equal health access for all people [33] and as indicator 3.8.1 \u201cCoverage of essential health services\u201d for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [34], Several studies have sought to prove that a country with high-value UHC scores will have a superior performance in dealing with the COVID-19 situation [35,36].This research project is supported by the Thailand Science research and Innovation Fund Chulalongkorn University (DIS66210025), Thailand; the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; and the UCL-Tohoku University Strategic Partner Funds and a COVID-19-related research support project (IRIDeS), Japan.",

This study examined universal health coverage (UHC) scores in relation to the performance in combating COVID-19 in the Southeast Asian region (SEAR) and the Western Pacific region (WPR), along with the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) index under the international health regulations (IHC). The numbers of infections and deaths per million population from December 2019 to June 2022 were used as primary outcomes to measure countries\u2019 performance. Countries with UHC scores of 63 or higher had a significantly lower number of infected patients and deaths. In addition, several inter-capacity correlations within the SPAR capacities, including with C8 (the National Health Emergency Framework), as well as a very strong correlation to C4 (Food Safety), C5 (Laboratory), and C7 (Human Resources). Furthermore, C9 (Health Service Provisions) has a very strong correlation to C1 (Legislation and Financing), C2 (International Health Regulation Coordination and a National IHR Focal Point function), and C4 (Food Safety), suggesting that the capability to manage an emerging infectious disease form blocks of capacities. In conclusion, UHC clearly mitigated the health-related consequences of COVID-19 in South-East Asia Region (SEAR) and Western Pacific Region (WPR). Investigating the correlation between the SPAR capacities and UHC is a promising approach for future research, including the importance of the provision of health services, points of entry, and, most importantly, risk communications as critical factors for managing pandemic. This study constitutes a good opportunity to apply the SPAR index to define which capacities correlate with the outcome of the pandemic in terms of infections and deaths.",
