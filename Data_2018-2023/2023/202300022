                "abstracts": "© 2023, Springer Nature Limited.Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a well-known class of immunotherapeutic drugs that have been used for effective treatment of several cancers. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) was the first antibody to target immune checkpoint PD-L1 and is now among the most commonly used anticancer therapies. However, this anti-PD-L1 antibody is produced in mammalian cells with high manufacturing costs, limiting cancer patients\u2019 access to the antibody treatment. Plant expression system is another platform that can be utilized, as they can synthesize complex glycoproteins, are rapidly scalable, and relatively cost-efficient. Herein, Atezolizumab was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana and demonstrated high expression level within 4\u20136 days post-infiltration. After purification by affinity chromatography, the purified plant-produced Atezolizumab was compared to Tecentriq and showed the absence of glycosylation. Furthermore, the plant-produced Atezolizumab could bind to PD-L1 with comparable affinity to Tecentriq in ELISA. The tumor growth inhibitory activity of plant-produced Atezolizumab in mice was also found to be similar to that of Tecentriq. These findings confirm the plant\u2019s capability to serve as an efficient production platform for immunotherapeutic antibodies and suggest that it could be used to alleviate the cost of existing anticancer products.",

        "dc:description": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a well-known class of immunotherapeutic drugs that have been used for effective treatment of several cancers. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) was the first antibody to target immune checkpoint PD-L1 and is now among the most commonly used anticancer therapies. However, this anti-PD-L1 antibody is produced in mammalian cells with high manufacturing costs, limiting cancer patients\u2019 access to the antibody treatment. Plant expression system is another platform that can be utilized, as they can synthesize complex glycoproteins, are rapidly scalable, and relatively cost-efficient. Herein, Atezolizumab was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana and demonstrated high expression level within 4\u20136 days post-infiltration. After purification by affinity chromatography, the purified plant-produced Atezolizumab was compared to Tecentriq and showed the absence of glycosylation. Furthermore, the plant-produced Atezolizumab could bind to PD-L1 with comparable affinity to Tecentriq in ELISA. The tumor growth inhibitory activity of plant-produced Atezolizumab in mice was also found to be similar to that of Tecentriq. These findings confirm the plant\u2019s capability to serve as an efficient production platform for immunotherapeutic antibodies and suggest that it could be used to alleviate the cost of existing anticancer products.",
