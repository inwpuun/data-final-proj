                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Society of The Nippon Dental University.This study aimed to compare the mean mineral density difference (mMDD) and surface morphology of 10- and 60-s silver diamine fluoride (SDF)-applied dentin carious lesions and to study the effect of an additional 20-s light curing (LC) on SDF-treated teeth. Forty primary molar blocks with natural dentin carious lesions were measured for baseline lesion depth and mineral density using Image-Pro Plus software. The samples were randomly distributed into 4 groups; 38% SDF applied for 1) 10-s (10SDF), 2) 60-s (60SDF), 3) 10-s + LC (10SDF + LC), 4) 60-s + LC (60SDF + LC) and an additional control group to assess the outcome of pH-cycling only. Then all the groups underwent a 7-d bacterial pH-cycling. The dentin carious lesions\u2019 mMDD was determined by digital subtraction radiographic analysis. The surface morphology and elemental profile were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The mMDD of the dentin lesions was analyzed using two-way ANOVA, generalized linear models analysis. Light curing was the only factor that affected the mMDD (p = 0.007). The mMDD in the 10SDF + LC and 60SDF + LC groups were significantly higher than those without light curing (p = 0.041 and 0.041, respectively). The 60SDF + LC group demonstrated a significantly higher mMDD than the 10SDF group (p = 0.010), while that in the 10SDF + LC group was similar to the 60SDF group (p = 1.00). Scanning electron microscopy revealed denser mineral content layers, which were likely silver and chloride, in the 10SDF + LC and 60SDF + LC groups than in the 10SDF and 60SDF groups, respectively. In conclusion, shortened application time with light curing enhanced SDF remineralization similarly to the conventional method.",

        "dc:description": "This study aimed to compare the mean mineral density difference (mMDD) and surface morphology of 10- and 60-s silver diamine fluoride (SDF)-applied dentin carious lesions and to study the effect of an additional 20-s light curing (LC) on SDF-treated teeth. Forty primary molar blocks with natural dentin carious lesions were measured for baseline lesion depth and mineral density using Image-Pro Plus software. The samples were randomly distributed into 4 groups; 38% SDF applied for 1) 10-s (10SDF), 2) 60-s (60SDF), 3) 10-s + LC (10SDF + LC), 4) 60-s + LC (60SDF + LC) and an additional control group to assess the outcome of pH-cycling only. Then all the groups underwent a 7-d bacterial pH-cycling. The dentin carious lesions\u2019 mMDD was determined by digital subtraction radiographic analysis. The surface morphology and elemental profile were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The mMDD of the dentin lesions was analyzed using two-way ANOVA, generalized linear models analysis. Light curing was the only factor that affected the mMDD (p = 0.007). The mMDD in the 10SDF + LC and 60SDF + LC groups were significantly higher than those without light curing (p = 0.041 and 0.041, respectively). The 60SDF + LC group demonstrated a significantly higher mMDD than the 10SDF group (p = 0.010), while that in the 10SDF + LC group was similar to the 60SDF group (p = 1.00). Scanning electron microscopy revealed denser mineral content layers, which were likely silver and chloride, in the 10SDF + LC and 60SDF + LC groups than in the 10SDF and 60SDF groups, respectively. In conclusion, shortened application time with light curing enhanced SDF remineralization similarly to the conventional method.",
