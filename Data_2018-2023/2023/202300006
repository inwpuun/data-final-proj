Values of P. betle concentration, with antimicrobial activity against S. pseudintermedius ED99, MSSP, MRSP, and S. aureus ATCC 29213 concurred with the MIC and MBC values at 250 μg/mL. According to the MBC/MIC ratio of less than four folds, P. betle was considered bactericidal (Mogana et al., 2020), supporting the time-kill results. After 18 h exposure, the bacteria were completely killed by P. betle, similar to the time-kill resutls of vancomycin."},

                "abstracts": "© 2023 Elsevier B.V.Ethnopharmacological relevance: Piper betle L. has potent of antimicrobial activity and is widely used as a traditional remedy to treat skin infections. However, no clear evidence exists concerning antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) opportunistic pathogens that cause wound infections and pyoderma in canines and zoonotic disease. Aim of the study: The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of P. betle extract were assessed against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP strains. Materials and methods: Ethanol leaf extract of P. betle was investigated for its antibacterial effect on S. pseudintermedius and MRSP by broth microdilution and time-kill assays. Biofilm inhibition and production assays were performed to evaluate antibiofilm and biofilm eradication effects, respectively. Biofilm-associated gene expression was further studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The possible interaction between IcaA and major compounds in P. betle was analyzed by molecular docking. Results: The extract showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 250 μg/mL. Growth inhibition of P. betle at 1 MIC against the bacteria was initially observed after treatment for 4 h. All isolates were completely killed after 18 h exposure to the extract. Minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs) of the extract against the tested isolates ranged 1/2 MIC to 1 MIC, while minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of P. betle was initialed at 8 MIC. Quantitative inhibition and eradication effects were observed in representative strains. The extract at 1/2 MIC and 1 MIC values inhibited biofilm formation up to 100%, with bacterial biofilm removed at up to 94.21% by 4 MIC of the extract. The extract downregulated the expression of the icaA gene among biofilm-producing isolates. The most abundant compounds, 4-allyl-1,2-diacetoxybenzene and eugenol showed a strong affinity with IcaA protein at −5.65 and −5.31 kcal/mol, respectively. Conclusions: P. betle extract demonstrated the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and biofilm-removal activity against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP. Downregulation of the icaA gene expression and protein interaction were possible modes of action of the extract that impacted biofilm production. This extract showed promise as an alternative treatment for S. pseudintermedius infection, especially drug-resistant and biofilm-associated cases.",

        "dc:description": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Piper betle L. has potent of antimicrobial activity and is widely used as a traditional remedy to treat skin infections. However, no clear evidence exists concerning antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) opportunistic pathogens that cause wound infections and pyoderma in canines and zoonotic disease. Aim of the study: The antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of P. betle extract were assessed against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP strains. Materials and methods: Ethanol leaf extract of P. betle was investigated for its antibacterial effect on S. pseudintermedius and MRSP by broth microdilution and time-kill assays. Biofilm inhibition and production assays were performed to evaluate antibiofilm and biofilm eradication effects, respectively. Biofilm-associated gene expression was further studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The possible interaction between IcaA and major compounds in P. betle was analyzed by molecular docking. Results: The extract showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 250 μg/mL. Growth inhibition of P. betle at 1 MIC against the bacteria was initially observed after treatment for 4 h. All isolates were completely killed after 18 h exposure to the extract. Minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs) of the extract against the tested isolates ranged 1/2 MIC to 1 MIC, while minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of P. betle was initialed at 8 MIC. Quantitative inhibition and eradication effects were observed in representative strains. The extract at 1/2 MIC and 1 MIC values inhibited biofilm formation up to 100%, with bacterial biofilm removed at up to 94.21% by 4 MIC of the extract. The extract downregulated the expression of the icaA gene among biofilm-producing isolates. The most abundant compounds, 4-allyl-1,2-diacetoxybenzene and eugenol showed a strong affinity with IcaA protein at −5.65 and −5.31 kcal/mol, respectively. Conclusions: P. betle extract demonstrated the antibacterial, antibiofilm, and biofilm-removal activity against S. pseudintermedius and MRSP. Downregulation of the icaA gene expression and protein interaction were possible modes of action of the extract that impacted biofilm production. This extract showed promise as an alternative treatment for S. pseudintermedius infection, especially drug-resistant and biofilm-associated cases.",
