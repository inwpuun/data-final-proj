                "abstracts": "© 2023, The Author(s).Glutamic acid-rich protein of Plasmodium falciparum (PfGARP) binds to erythrocyte band 3 and may enhance cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes. Naturally acquired anti-PfGARP antibodies could confer protection against high parasitemia and severe symptoms. While whole genome sequencing analysis has suggested high conservation in this locus, little is known about repeat polymorphism in this vaccine candidate antigen. Direct sequencing was performed from the PCR-amplified complete PfGARP gene of 80 clinical isolates from four malaria endemic provinces in Thailand and an isolate from a Guinean patient. Publicly available complete coding sequences of this locus were included for comparative analysis. Six complex repeat (RI-RVI) and two homopolymeric glutamic acid repeat (E1 and E2) domains were identified in PfGARP. The erythrocyte band 3-binding ligand in domain RIV and the epitope for mAB7899 antibody eliciting in vitro parasite killing property were perfectly conserved across isolates. Repeat lengths in domains RIII and E1-RVI-E2 seemed to be correlated with parasite density of the patients. Sequence variation in PfGARP exhibited genetic differentiation across most endemic areas of Thailand. Phylogenetic tree inferred from this locus has shown that most Thai isolates formed closely related lineages, suggesting local expansion/contractions of repeat-encoding regions. Positive selection was observed in non-repeat region preceding domain RII which corresponded to a helper T cell epitope predicted to be recognized by a common HLA class II among Thai population. Predicted linear B cell epitopes were identified in both repeat and non-repeat domains. Besides length variation in some repeat domains, sequence conservation in non-repeat regions and almost all predicted immunogenic epitopes have suggested that PfGARP-derived vaccine may largely elicit strain-transcending immunity.",

Naturally acquired anti-PfGARP antibodies could confer protection against high parasitemia and severe symptoms. While whole genome sequencing analysis has suggested high conservation in this locus, little is known about repeat polymorphism in this vaccine candidate antigen. Direct sequencing was performed from the PCR-amplified complete PfGARP gene of 80 clinical isolates from four malaria endemic provinces in Thailand and an isolate from a Guinean patient. Publicly available complete coding sequences of this locus were included for comparative analysis. Six complex repeat (RI-RVI) and two homopolymeric glutamic acid repeat (E1 and E2) domains were identified in PfGARP. The erythrocyte band 3-binding ligand in domain RIV and the epitope for mAB7899 antibody eliciting in vitro parasite killing property were perfectly conserved across isolates. Repeat lengths in domains RIII and E1-RVI-E2 seemed to be correlated with parasite density of the patients. Sequence variation in PfGARP exhibited genetic differentiation across most endemic areas of Thailand. Phylogenetic tree inferred from this locus has shown that most Thai isolates formed closely related lineages, suggesting local expansion/contractions of repeat-encoding regions. Positive selection was observed in non-repeat region preceding domain RII which corresponded to a helper T cell epitope predicted to be recognized by a common HLA class II among Thai population. Predicted linear B cell epitopes were identified in both repeat and non-repeat domains. Besides length variation in some repeat domains, sequence conservation in non-repeat regions and almost all predicted immunogenic epitopes have suggested that PfGARP-derived vaccine may largely elicit strain-transcending immunity.",
