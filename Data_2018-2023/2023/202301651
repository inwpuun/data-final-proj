                "abstracts": "© 2023 The Authors. Reviews in Aquaculture published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Tilapia aquaculture is a major source of animal protein, with global production reaching over 6 million tonnes in 2020. The rapid growth of the tilapia sector has led to a number of emerging disease threats and subsequent production losses. Risk analysis can provide a targeted approach for improving biosecurity in the tilapia sector. The aim of this work was to describe the tilapia value chain and review the important infectious agents of tilapia that may affect the different points along the value chain; such points include input and service suppliers, producers (i.e., hatcheries, nurseries and grow-out farms), and processors, traders and marketers. We then describe how risk analysis can be used to identify critical controls points along the value chain and describe potential risk mitigation measures that may be implemented at those points. The control of diseases of tilapia requires a multi-faceted approach, with risk-based control measures chosen based on their feasibility, effectiveness and sustainability. The Progressive Management Pathway for Improving Aquaculture Biosecurity, as a risk-based, collaborative and progressive management approach combined with the systematic preventive principles of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, offers a strategic and practical way of improving biosecurity in the tilapia value chain.",

The rapid growth of the tilapia sector has led to a number of emerging disease threats and subsequent production losses. Risk analysis can provide a targeted approach for improving biosecurity in the tilapia sector. The aim of this work was to describe the tilapia value chain and review the important infectious agents of tilapia that may affect the different points along the value chain; such points include input and service suppliers, producers (i.e., hatcheries, nurseries and grow-out farms), and processors, traders and marketers. We then describe how risk analysis can be used to identify critical controls points along the value chain and describe potential risk mitigation measures that may be implemented at those points. The control of diseases of tilapia requires a multi-faceted approach, with risk-based control measures chosen based on their feasibility, effectiveness and sustainability. The Progressive Management Pathway for Improving Aquaculture Biosecurity, as a risk-based, collaborative and progressive management approach combined with the systematic preventive principles of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, offers a strategic and practical way of improving biosecurity in the tilapia value chain.",
