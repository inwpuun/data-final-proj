J. of GEOMATE All rights reserved, including making copies, unless permission is obtained from the copyright proprietors.This paper proposes alternative physical and environmental features for the military housing welfare system, aimed at increasing stability and improving the quality of life in accordance with welfare objectives. The study examines welfare-related concepts, theories, studies, laws, and the management of homes in mixed-housing developments. Primary data was gathered through surveys and interviews, while secondary data was obtained from relevant documents and sources. Based on this data, a virtual project was developed to evaluate the progress of the proposed features and to determine how to integrate the concept of an integrated military housing welfare system into the physical features and surroundings of the project. The project's viability was assessed over a 30-year period from legal, financial, and practical perspectives. The results provide a framework for more adaptable and effective project management, which could be applied to other charity housing programs, and also address the shortcomings of previous government-run welfare housing schemes.",

The study examines welfare-related concepts, theories, studies, laws, and the management of homes in mixed-housing developments. Primary data was gathered through surveys and interviews, while secondary data was obtained from relevant documents and sources. Based on this data, a virtual project was developed to evaluate the progress of the proposed features and to determine how to integrate the concept of an integrated military housing welfare system into the physical features and surroundings of the project. The project's viability was assessed over a 30-year period from legal, financial, and practical perspectives. The results provide a framework for more adaptable and effective project management, which could be applied to other charity housing programs, and also address the shortcomings of previous government-run welfare housing schemes.",
