Recently, molecular classification was established and started to play a role in the management of MB; however, studies involving molecular defined MB in Southeast Asia have been limited. We aimed to describe, and correlate clinical characteristics and molecular subgroups with therapeutic outcomes of Thai pediatric patients with MB. Materials and methods Pediatric MB patients treated at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Thailand from 2006 to 2018 were recruited. Patients were classified by clinical characteristics into standard- and high-risk groups, which determined treatment regimen. Retrospectively, available tumor tissues were classified into 3 molecular subgroups using immunohistochemistry: 1) WNT, 2) SHH, and 3) non-WNT/non-SHH. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). Risk factors associated with OS were analyzed using cox regression analysis. Results Fifty-three Thai pediatric patients with MB were enrolled. The median follow-up time was 60 months. The 5-year OS for all patients, and patients with standard-risk and high-risk were 74.2%, 76.3% and 71.4%, respectively. Tumor tissues of 24 patients were available, of which 23 could be molecularly classified. Two, one and 20 were in the WNT, SHH and nonWNT/non-SHH subtypes with 5-year OS of 100%, 100% and 78.9%, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, the interval of more than 8 weeks between surgery and radiotherapy was significantly correlated with a decrease in the 5-year OS. Conclusion Interval between surgery and radiotherapy within 8 weeks was associated with good therapeutic outcomes among Thai pediatric patients with MB. Simplified molecular subtyping combined with clinical characteristics is practical in risk classification of patients with MB in institutes with limited resources.",

        "dc:description": "Introduction Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common childhood malignant brain tumor worldwide. Recently, molecular classification was established and started to play a role in the management of MB; however, studies involving molecular defined MB in Southeast Asia have been limited. We aimed to describe, and correlate clinical characteristics and molecular subgroups with therapeutic outcomes of Thai pediatric patients with MB. Materials and methods Pediatric MB patients treated at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Thailand from 2006 to 2018 were recruited. Patients were classified by clinical characteristics into standard- and high-risk groups, which determined treatment regimen. Retrospectively, available tumor tissues were classified into 3 molecular subgroups using immunohistochemistry: 1) WNT, 2) SHH, and 3) non-WNT/non-SHH. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). Risk factors associated with OS were analyzed using cox regression analysis. Results Fifty-three Thai pediatric patients with MB were enrolled. The median follow-up time was 60 months. The 5-year OS for all patients, and patients with standard-risk and high-risk were 74.2%, 76.3% and 71.4%, respectively. Tumor tissues of 24 patients were available, of which 23 could be molecularly classified. Two, one and 20 were in the WNT, SHH and nonWNT/non-SHH subtypes with 5-year OS of 100%, 100% and 78.9%, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, the interval of more than 8 weeks between surgery and radiotherapy was significantly correlated with a decrease in the 5-year OS. Conclusion Interval between surgery and radiotherapy within 8 weeks was associated with good therapeutic outcomes among Thai pediatric patients with MB. Simplified molecular subtyping combined with clinical characteristics is practical in risk classification of patients with MB in institutes with limited resources.",
