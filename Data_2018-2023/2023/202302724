                {"$": "The adoption of RHA was revealed to be positively associated with the car purchasing intention, especially among younger and higher-income individuals. Our results suggested that the findings in previous studies that RHA adoption might lead to the reduction in private car purchase should not be over generalized. Furthermore, our finding of a positive association between RHA adoption and car purchasing intention may raise concern over the sustainability of RHA. The policy implications of findings in this study may involve the need to promote environmentally-friendly personal mobility (e.g., electric vehicle) alongside comprehensive public transport network development. While Bangkok is beginning to embark on public and private sector policies to encourage EV use, it remains an open question if those who intend to purchase a car will make the switch from internal combustion engine vehicles, as well as if RHA companies and public transport operators are prepared to support a transition to EV vehicles among their fleet. Given Bangkok's highly stratified economic classes, a sustainable and just approach to mitigating emissions should ensure that all social classes have access to environmentally-friendly transportation, be it public or private.This study was financially supported by the Kajima Foundation's International Joint Research Grant.

Using a large-scale public survey of residents in Bangkok, Thailand, our study dissects the relationship between RHA adoption and the intention to purchase a new car. While research from other counties have suggested that RHA use decreases the need to own a car, the context in Thailand is more complex. Our findings based on data analysis using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression reveal that certain sociodemographic characteristics of RHA users \u2014 namely younger and higher income individuals \u2014 were positively associated with an intention to buy a car. Still, residents who solely rely on public transportation were less likely to purchase a car compared to those who use multiple forms of transportation, suggesting that the development of comprehensive and affordable public transit could serve a substitution for RHA.",

Our results suggested that the findings in previous studies that RHA adoption might lead to the reduction in private car purchase should not be over generalized. Furthermore, our finding of a positive association between RHA adoption and car purchasing intention may raise concern over the sustainability of RHA. The policy implications of findings in this study may involve the need to promote environmentally-friendly personal mobility (e.g., electric vehicle) alongside comprehensive public transport network development. While Bangkok is beginning to embark on public and private sector policies to encourage EV use, it remains an open question if those who intend to purchase a car will make the switch from internal combustion engine vehicles, as well as if RHA companies and public transport operators are prepared to support a transition to EV vehicles among their fleet. Given Bangkok's highly stratified economic classes, a sustainable and just approach to mitigating emissions should ensure that all social classes have access to environmentally-friendly transportation, be it public or private.This study was financially supported by the Kajima Foundation's International Joint Research Grant.

Using a large-scale public survey of residents in Bangkok, Thailand, our study dissects the relationship between RHA adoption and the intention to purchase a new car. While research from other counties have suggested that RHA use decreases the need to own a car, the context in Thailand is more complex. Our findings based on data analysis using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression reveal that certain sociodemographic characteristics of RHA users \u2014 namely younger and higher income individuals \u2014 were positively associated with an intention to buy a car. Still, residents who solely rely on public transportation were less likely to purchase a car compared to those who use multiple forms of transportation, suggesting that the development of comprehensive and affordable public transit could serve a substitution for RHA.",
