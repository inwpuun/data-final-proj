                "abstracts": "© 2023 Elsevier B.V.This qualitative study aimed to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) on swine influenza (SIV) among pig farm owners, pig farm workers, community leaders, public health personnel, and villagers who lived nearby pig farms in the northeastern (Nakhon Ratchasima), northern (Chiang Mai), and central (Nakhon Pathom) provinces of Thailand during May to December 2022. The qualitative information was collected from 91 respondents, including 33 individuals who participated in key informant interviews (KIIs) and 58 individuals who joined ten focus group discussions (FGDs) (5\u20137 persons per FGD). Our results showed that pig farmers, farm workers, and villagers lacked SIV-related knowledge and did not employ preventive measures. Some respondents had limited access to information about causes, clinical symptoms, treatment, and appropriate practices resulting in inadequate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding zoonotic diseases, especially SIV. Some pig farmers and farm workers reported seeking information about SIV infection from various sources; however, relevant authorities lacked dissemination of information regarding SIV to community members. The study suggested that healthcare personnel and relevant agencies should adopt a community-based approach to prevent swine influenza. This can be achieved by organizing health education and community communication interventions and involving those who have had contact with pigs or reside near pig farms. This will help increase community awareness and knowledge of swine influenza.",

        "dc:description": "This qualitative study aimed to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) on swine influenza (SIV) among pig farm owners, pig farm workers, community leaders, public health personnel, and villagers who lived nearby pig farms in the northeastern (Nakhon Ratchasima), northern (Chiang Mai), and central (Nakhon Pathom) provinces of Thailand during May to December 2022. The qualitative information was collected from 91 respondents, including 33 individuals who participated in key informant interviews (KIIs) and 58 individuals who joined ten focus group discussions (FGDs) (5\u20137 persons per FGD). Our results showed that pig farmers, farm workers, and villagers lacked SIV-related knowledge and did not employ preventive measures. Some respondents had limited access to information about causes, clinical symptoms, treatment, and appropriate practices resulting in inadequate knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding zoonotic diseases, especially SIV. Some pig farmers and farm workers reported seeking information about SIV infection from various sources; however, relevant authorities lacked dissemination of information regarding SIV to community members. The study suggested that healthcare personnel and relevant agencies should adopt a community-based approach to prevent swine influenza. This can be achieved by organizing health education and community communication interventions and involving those who have had contact with pigs or reside near pig farms. This will help increase community awareness and knowledge of swine influenza.",
