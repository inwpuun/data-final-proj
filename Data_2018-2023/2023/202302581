It presents the Movement-based Intervention Manual (MAMT) for Assessing and Treating Trauma survivors. The proposed intervention model is based on a study which explored bodily movements of trauma victims as they recounted traumatic memories, and on the practical implications of the bodily movement categories found to be manifest when a traumatic event is recalled. Evidence indicates a relationship between non-verbal expressions and the emotional, verbal narratives of a traumatic event.",

It presents the Movement-based Intervention Manual (MAMT) for Assessing and Treating Trauma survivors. The proposed intervention model is based on a study which explored bodily movements of trauma victims as they recounted traumatic memories, and on the practical implications of the bodily movement categories found to be manifest when a traumatic event is recalled. Evidence indicates a relationship between non-verbal expressions and the emotional, verbal narratives of a traumatic event.",
