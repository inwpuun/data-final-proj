                "abstracts": "© 2023, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common degenerative joint diseases leading to disability in the end stage. Although intra\u2011articular triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is one of the OA treatments that have been widely used, the side effects of such corticosteroids are still controversial. Intra\u2011articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injection is another therapeutic option for patients with OA who do not want to use corticosteroids because of their side effects. However, the difference between the histological features associated with TA and HA in the treatment of OA remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to compare the histological effects of TA and HA on the cartilage of patients with knee OA. In the current study, 31 patients diagnosed with grade 3\u20114 knee OA on the Kellgren\u2011Lawrence radiographic grading scale were separated into three groups: TA (n=12); HA (n=7) and untreated group (n=12). Histological examination of the whole articular cartilages of the patients was performed with hematoxylin and eosin and Alcian staining, as well as using a TUNEL assay. Clinical data such as cartilage thickness, structural and component deterioration, proteoglycan levels, apoptosis and empty lacunae were compared between the three groups. The results showed a high level of deterioration in both TA and HA groups but not in the untreated group, although the thickness of cartilage in the HA group was lower compared with that in the TA and untreated groups. The proteoglycan levels in the TA group were lower compared with those in the HA group. Moreover, the number of empty lacunae in the HA group was higher compared with that in the TA group, while no difference in apoptosis was found between TA and HA groups. A significant difference was not found in the histological staining between TA and HA groups. On the other hand, a significant difference was found in cartilage deterioration between the medial and lateral sides in these groups. TA and HA groups showed comparable histological results. TA injection is cheaper and easier but has more adverse effects for patients with knee OA than HA injection. Therefore, orthopaedists should select TA or HA based on the economic and specific needs of patients.",

        "dc:description": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common degenerative joint diseases leading to disability in the end stage. Although intra\u2011articular triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is one of the OA treatments that have been widely used, the side effects of such corticosteroids are still controversial. Intra\u2011articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injection is another therapeutic option for patients with OA who do not want to use corticosteroids because of their side effects. However, the difference between the histological features associated with TA and HA in the treatment of OA remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to compare the histological effects of TA and HA on the cartilage of patients with knee OA. In the current study, 31 patients diagnosed with grade 3\u20114 knee OA on the Kellgren\u2011Lawrence radiographic grading scale were separated into three groups: TA (n=12); HA (n=7) and untreated group (n=12). Histological examination of the whole articular cartilages of the patients was performed with hematoxylin and eosin and Alcian staining, as well as using a TUNEL assay. Clinical data such as cartilage thickness, structural and component deterioration, proteoglycan levels, apoptosis and empty lacunae were compared between the three groups. The results showed a high level of deterioration in both TA and HA groups but not in the untreated group, although the thickness of cartilage in the HA group was lower compared with that in the TA and untreated groups. The proteoglycan levels in the TA group were lower compared with those in the HA group. Moreover, the number of empty lacunae in the HA group was higher compared with that in the TA group, while no difference in apoptosis was found between TA and HA groups. A significant difference was not found in the histological staining between TA and HA groups. On the other hand, a significant difference was found in cartilage deterioration between the medial and lateral sides in these groups. TA and HA groups showed comparable histological results. TA injection is cheaper and easier but has more adverse effects for patients with knee OA than HA injection. Therefore, orthopaedists should select TA or HA based on the economic and specific needs of patients.",
