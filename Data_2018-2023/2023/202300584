                "abstracts": "© 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.Background: In locoregional esophageal carcinoma (EC), airway involvement is the most common route of extraesophageal metastasis. The prognosis remains poor even with a multimodality approach. Although airway stenting is well known for restoration of the airway, the survival benefit is still lacking. Methods: A total of 37 of patients with airway involvement from EC who underwent airway stenting at a single institution from 2015 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Survival curves after stent placement among different groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 37 patients, 34 were male, and the mean age was 58.9 years (42 to 80). EC was commonly located at midesophagus (51.4%). The site of airway involvement was left main bronchus (48.6%), trachea (32.4%), multiple sites (16.2%), and right main bronchus (2.7%). The nature of airway involvement was tumor invasion (91.9%), compression (62.2%), and fistula (37.8%). Twenty-three patients (62.2%) had airway involvement at the time of esophageal cancer diagnosis. Only 4 patients underwent esophageal stenting. The median survival time after stent placement was 97 days (5 to 539). Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were given before stent placement in 18 patients (48.6%). Treatment-naive before airway stenting and diagnosis of airway involvement at the same time of EC diagnosis were independent predictors for the increased survival after stent placement (P<0.05). Poststent treatment was associated with improved survival (P=0.002). Conclusion: In patients with malignant airway involvement from EC who underwent airway stenting, the prognostic predictors for improved survival were treatment-naive status, receiving treatment after airway stenting, and early-onset of airway involvement.",

        "dc:description": "Background: In locoregional esophageal carcinoma (EC), airway involvement is the most common route of extraesophageal metastasis. The prognosis remains poor even with a multimodality approach. Although airway stenting is well known for restoration of the airway, the survival benefit is still lacking. Methods: A total of 37 of patients with airway involvement from EC who underwent airway stenting at a single institution from 2015 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Survival curves after stent placement among different groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 37 patients, 34 were male, and the mean age was 58.9 years (42 to 80). EC was commonly located at midesophagus (51.4%). The site of airway involvement was left main bronchus (48.6%), trachea (32.4%), multiple sites (16.2%), and right main bronchus (2.7%). The nature of airway involvement was tumor invasion (91.9%), compression (62.2%), and fistula (37.8%). Twenty-three patients (62.2%) had airway involvement at the time of esophageal cancer diagnosis. Only 4 patients underwent esophageal stenting. The median survival time after stent placement was 97 days (5 to 539). Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were given before stent placement in 18 patients (48.6%). Treatment-naive before airway stenting and diagnosis of airway involvement at the same time of EC diagnosis were independent predictors for the increased survival after stent placement (P<0.05). Poststent treatment was associated with improved survival (P=0.002). Conclusion: In patients with malignant airway involvement from EC who underwent airway stenting, the prognostic predictors for improved survival were treatment-naive status, receiving treatment after airway stenting, and early-onset of airway involvement.",
