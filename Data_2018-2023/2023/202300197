                "abstracts": "Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Oil spillage has serious adverse effects on marine environments. The degradation of crude oil by microorganisms may be an effective and sustainable approach. In this study, the removal of crude oil from seawater by immobilized bacterial consortium was performed and the enhancement of crude oil degradation efficiency by varying immobilization methods and inoculum volume ratio was examined. The nonpathogenic and heavy metal-tolerant bacterial consortium of Sphingobium naphthae MO2-4 and Priestia aryabhattai TL01-2 was immobilized by biofilm formation on aquaporousgels. The simultaneous immobilization of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 showed better crude oil removal efficiency than independent immobilization, which indicated positive interactions among consortium members in the mixed-culture immobilized systems. Moreover, the immobilized consortium at a 2:1 (MO2-4:TL01-2) inoculum volume ratio showed the best crude oil removal capacity. The immobilized consortium removed 77% of 2000 mg L-1 crude oil in seawater over 7 days. The immobilized consortium maintained crude oil removal efficacy in semicontinuous experiments. In addition, the immobilized consortium was used to remediate seawater contaminated with 1000 mg L-1 crude oil in a 20 L wave tank. After 28 days, the crude oil degradation efficiency of immobilized consortium was approximately 70%, and crude oil degradation through natural attenuation was not observed. Moreover, the genomic features of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 are reported. Genomic analyses of both strains confirmed the presence of many genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation, heavy metal resistance, biosurfactant synthesis, and biofilm formation, supporting the biodegradation results and characterizing strain properties. The results of this work introduce the potential benefit of simultaneous immobilization of bacterial consortia to improve efficiency of crude oil biodegradation and has motivated further investigations into large-scale remediation of crude oil-contaminated seawater.",

        "dc:description": "Oil spillage has serious adverse effects on marine environments. The degradation of crude oil by microorganisms may be an effective and sustainable approach. In this study, the removal of crude oil from seawater by immobilized bacterial consortium was performed and the enhancement of crude oil degradation efficiency by varying immobilization methods and inoculum volume ratio was examined. The nonpathogenic and heavy metal-tolerant bacterial consortium of Sphingobium naphthae MO2-4 and Priestia aryabhattai TL01-2 was immobilized by biofilm formation on aquaporousgels. The simultaneous immobilization of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 showed better crude oil removal efficiency than independent immobilization, which indicated positive interactions among consortium members in the mixed-culture immobilized systems. Moreover, the immobilized consortium at a 2:1 (MO2-4:TL01-2) inoculum volume ratio showed the best crude oil removal capacity. The immobilized consortium removed 77% of 2000 mg L-1 crude oil in seawater over 7 days. The immobilized consortium maintained crude oil removal efficacy in semicontinuous experiments. In addition, the immobilized consortium was used to remediate seawater contaminated with 1000 mg L-1 crude oil in a 20 L wave tank. After 28 days, the crude oil degradation efficiency of immobilized consortium was approximately 70%, and crude oil degradation through natural attenuation was not observed. Moreover, the genomic features of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 are reported. Genomic analyses of both strains confirmed the presence of many genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation, heavy metal resistance, biosurfactant synthesis, and biofilm formation, supporting the biodegradation results and characterizing strain properties. The results of this work introduce the potential benefit of simultaneous immobilization of bacterial consortia to improve efficiency of crude oil biodegradation and has motivated further investigations into large-scale remediation of crude oil-contaminated seawater.",
