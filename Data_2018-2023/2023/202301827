                "abstracts": "© 2022 The AuthorsPeroxiredoxin (Prx), an antioxidant enzyme family, has been identified as immune modulating damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in mammals but not in shrimp. Acute non-lethal heat shock (NLHS) that enhances shrimp Penaeus vannamei resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus causing acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (VPAHPND). Among the five P. vannamei Prxs (LvPrx) isoforms, LvPrx4, the most abundant in unchallenged shrimp hemocytes that was upregulated in hemocytes following NLHS treatment, is of great interest. The escalation of the LvPrx4 monomer in hemolymph of NLHS treated shrimp indicates that it probably acts as DAMP. This study revealed that pre-challenge with rLvPrx4 could prolong VPAHPND-infected shrimp survival, increase prophenoloxidase (proPO) activity and promote Toll pathway-related genes expression mediated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 and 2. The presented findings elucidated the molecular mechanism of LvPrx4 monomer as DAMP in NLHS-induced VPAHPND resistance by inducing the TLR1/2 signaling pathway and the proPO activating system.",

Acute non-lethal heat shock (NLHS) that enhances shrimp Penaeus vannamei resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus causing acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (VPAHPND). Among the five P. vannamei Prxs (LvPrx) isoforms, LvPrx4, the most abundant in unchallenged shrimp hemocytes that was upregulated in hemocytes following NLHS treatment, is of great interest. The escalation of the LvPrx4 monomer in hemolymph of NLHS treated shrimp indicates that it probably acts as DAMP. This study revealed that pre-challenge with rLvPrx4 could prolong VPAHPND-infected shrimp survival, increase prophenoloxidase (proPO) activity and promote Toll pathway-related genes expression mediated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 and 2. The presented findings elucidated the molecular mechanism of LvPrx4 monomer as DAMP in NLHS-induced VPAHPND resistance by inducing the TLR1/2 signaling pathway and the proPO activating system.",
