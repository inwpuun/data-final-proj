                "abstracts": "© 2023 The AuthorsObjective: To evaluate immunogenicity and safety of heterologous COVID-19 primary vaccination regimens of CoronaVac with fractional and standard BNT162b2 dosages in 5\u201311-year-old Thai children. Methods: This prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized control trial divided participants 1:1:1:1 to receive a second dose of either standard (10-μg) or half-dose (5-μg) BNT162b2 vaccines as follows: CoronaVac/10-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 1), CoronaVac/5-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 2), 10-μg-BNT162b2/10-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 3), or 10-μg-BNT162b2/5-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 4). A subset of participants from each arm received 10-μg-BNT162b2 booster (third) doses 16 weeks after their second vaccination. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity were assessed and adverse events (AEs) digitally self-reported. Results: Of 553 enrolled participants, 50 % were male, the median (interquartile range) age was 8.65 (7.00, 10.00) years, and a majority (91 %) had normal weight-for-height. All participants exhibited similarly robust neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against the ancestral Wuhan strain two weeks after the second vaccination, with titers highest in Group 1 (737.60, 95% CI [654.80, 830.88]), followed by Groups 3 (630.42, 95% CI [555.50, 715.45]), 2 (593.98, 95% CI [506.02, 697.23]), and 4 (451.79, 95% CI [388.62, 525.23]), as well as 56.01 % and 49.68 % seroconversion for BA.1 and BA.5, respectively. Half-dose BNT162b2 as a second dose induced significantly lower NAb titers compared to their respective full-dose regimens (p = 0.03 for Groups 1 vs 2 and p < 0.001 for Groups 3 vs 4). 77.71 % of participants developed SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein-specific T-cell responses two weeks after the second vaccination. This was similar across arms. Booster doses generated NAb titers 5.69\u201311.51-folds higher than the second vaccination against BA.1. AEs were similar across arms, all mild or moderate, and fully resolved 2\u20133 days thereafter. Conclusion: Standard and fractional heterologous regimens of CoronaVac-BNT162b2 induced similar or higher humoral immunity than homologous BNT162b2 and represent alternative vaccine regimens for children. These findings are highly relevant in settings concurrently using both vaccines.",

        "dc:description": "Objective: To evaluate immunogenicity and safety of heterologous COVID-19 primary vaccination regimens of CoronaVac with fractional and standard BNT162b2 dosages in 5\u201311-year-old Thai children. Methods: This prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized control trial divided participants 1:1:1:1 to receive a second dose of either standard (10-μg) or half-dose (5-μg) BNT162b2 vaccines as follows: CoronaVac/10-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 1), CoronaVac/5-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 2), 10-μg-BNT162b2/10-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 3), or 10-μg-BNT162b2/5-μg-BNT162b2 (Group 4). A subset of participants from each arm received 10-μg-BNT162b2 booster (third) doses 16 weeks after their second vaccination. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity were assessed and adverse events (AEs) digitally self-reported. Results: Of 553 enrolled participants, 50 % were male, the median (interquartile range) age was 8.65 (7.00, 10.00) years, and a majority (91 %) had normal weight-for-height. All participants exhibited similarly robust neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against the ancestral Wuhan strain two weeks after the second vaccination, with titers highest in Group 1 (737.60, 95% CI [654.80, 830.88]), followed by Groups 3 (630.42, 95% CI [555.50, 715.45]), 2 (593.98, 95% CI [506.02, 697.23]), and 4 (451.79, 95% CI [388.62, 525.23]), as well as 56.01 % and 49.68 % seroconversion for BA.1 and BA.5, respectively. Half-dose BNT162b2 as a second dose induced significantly lower NAb titers compared to their respective full-dose regimens (p = 0.03 for Groups 1 vs 2 and p < 0.001 for Groups 3 vs 4). 77.71 % of participants developed SARS-CoV-2 ancestral spike protein-specific T-cell responses two weeks after the second vaccination. This was similar across arms. Booster doses generated NAb titers 5.69\u201311.51-folds higher than the second vaccination against BA.1. AEs were similar across arms, all mild or moderate, and fully resolved 2\u20133 days thereafter. Conclusion: Standard and fractional heterologous regimens of CoronaVac-BNT162b2 induced similar or higher humoral immunity than homologous BNT162b2 and represent alternative vaccine regimens for children. These findings are highly relevant in settings concurrently using both vaccines.",
