                "abstracts": "© 2023, Springer Nature Limited.Adsorption is regarded as an efficient method to eliminate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from an aqueous solution. In the present investigation, an adsorbent based on rice husks (RHs) was successfully prepared by phosphoric acid (PA) activation and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment, and it was used to adsorb perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from water. The electrodes employed in the experiment were planar type. This research investigated RH surface properties and adsorption capacity before and after modification using DBD plasma. The results revealed that the He\u2013O2 plasma modification introduced oxygen-containing functional groups and increased the PFOA removal efficiency. Increasing the oxygen content and total gas flow rate to 30 vol.% and 1.5 L/min, respectively, with 10 min of RH plasma treatment time at 100 W plasma discharge power enhanced the PFOA removal efficiency to 92.0%, while non-treated RH showed the removal efficiency of only 46.4%. The removal efficiency of the solution increased to 96.7% upon adjusting the pH to 4. The adsorption equilibrium isotherms fitted the Langmuir model, and the adsorption kinetic followed the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity was 565 mg/g when the Langmuir isotherm model was applied.",

In the present investigation, an adsorbent based on rice husks (RHs) was successfully prepared by phosphoric acid (PA) activation and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment, and it was used to adsorb perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from water. The electrodes employed in the experiment were planar type. This research investigated RH surface properties and adsorption capacity before and after modification using DBD plasma. The results revealed that the He\u2013O2 plasma modification introduced oxygen-containing functional groups and increased the PFOA removal efficiency. Increasing the oxygen content and total gas flow rate to 30 vol.% and 1.5 L/min, respectively, with 10 min of RH plasma treatment time at 100 W plasma discharge power enhanced the PFOA removal efficiency to 92.0%, while non-treated RH showed the removal efficiency of only 46.4%. The removal efficiency of the solution increased to 96.7% upon adjusting the pH to 4. The adsorption equilibrium isotherms fitted the Langmuir model, and the adsorption kinetic followed the pseudo-second-order model. The maximum adsorption capacity was 565 mg/g when the Langmuir isotherm model was applied.",
