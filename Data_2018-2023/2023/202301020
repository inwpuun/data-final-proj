All rights reserved.Oil, gas, and water distribution networks in remote locations require optimized data transmission from their sources to prevent or detect leakage or improve production flow in their manufacturing units. Remote oil and gas installations frequently encounter substantial obstacles in terms of data connectivity and transfer. Slow data transmission rates, data loss, and decision-making delays can all be caused by a lack of dependable network infrastructure, restricted bandwidth, and severe climatic conditions. The purpose of this research work is to identify critical concerns concerning data communication and data transfer in oil and gas distant areas and to investigate feasible approaches to these challenges. The survey was carried out to gather feedback from oil and gas experts on issues concerning data transmission in remote locations. This study provides a theoretical approach to optimizing data transmission and communication in remote areas using Sky X technology. This study presents a new theoretical method that improves the performance of IP over satellite using the critical aspects of data transmission issues from experts. This technology's contribution can improve the reliability of all users on a satellite network by delivering all features with a successful data transfer rate discreetly. This attempt may also aid oil and gas companies in optimizing data transmission/communication in remote regions.",

        "dc:description": "Oil, gas, and water distribution networks in remote locations require optimized data transmission from their sources to prevent or detect leakage or improve production flow in their manufacturing units. Remote oil and gas installations frequently encounter substantial obstacles in terms of data connectivity and transfer. Slow data transmission rates, data loss, and decision-making delays can all be caused by a lack of dependable network infrastructure, restricted bandwidth, and severe climatic conditions. The purpose of this research work is to identify critical concerns concerning data communication and data transfer in oil and gas distant areas and to investigate feasible approaches to these challenges. The survey was carried out to gather feedback from oil and gas experts on issues concerning data transmission in remote locations. This study provides a theoretical approach to optimizing data transmission and communication in remote areas using Sky X technology. This study presents a new theoretical method that improves the performance of IP over satellite using the critical aspects of data transmission issues from experts. This technology's contribution can improve the reliability of all users on a satellite network by delivering all features with a successful data transfer rate discreetly. This attempt may also aid oil and gas companies in optimizing data transmission/communication in remote regions.",
