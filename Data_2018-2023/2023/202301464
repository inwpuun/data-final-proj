This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Objective The aim of this study was to cross-culturally adapt the child\u2019s self-report and parental report of the scale of oral health outcomes for 5-year-old children (SOHO-5) for use in Myanmar (Burmese-speaking) population and to assess the reliability and validity of the Myanmar version. Materials and methods The forward-backward translation method was used to develop the Myanmar SOHO-5 version and the final questionnaires were tested on 173 five years old children and their parents for reliability and validity. A single dentist examined the caries experience of the children (Kappa:0.90). The structural validity was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability (1\u20132 weeks) were evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. The association between SOHO-5 scores and additional global rating questions for child oral health status (convergent validity) and the differences between the total SOHO-5 score of children with caries and children without caries (discriminant validity) were investigated. Results A confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit for the one-factor structure of the SOHO-5. Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient values for internal consistency were 0.82 for the children\u2019s report and 0.79 for the parental report. The ICCs were 0.90 and 0.89 for the total scores of the children and parental versions in the test-retest reliability analysis. The total SOHO-5 scores for both reports were significantly associated with the global rating questions except for the\u2019impact on children\u2019s general health\u2019 question in the parental report. Furthermore, the Myanmar version discriminated between the children with and without caries experiences (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study provided evidence that both children and parental reports of the Myanmar SOHO-5 version have good reliability and validity to assess the OHRQoL of 5-year-old children in a Burmese-speaking population.",

Materials and methods The forward-backward translation method was used to develop the Myanmar SOHO-5 version and the final questionnaires were tested on 173 five years old children and their parents for reliability and validity. A single dentist examined the caries experience of the children (Kappa:0.90). The structural validity was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability (1\u20132 weeks) were evaluated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively. The association between SOHO-5 scores and additional global rating questions for child oral health status (convergent validity) and the differences between the total SOHO-5 score of children with caries and children without caries (discriminant validity) were investigated. Results A confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit for the one-factor structure of the SOHO-5. Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient values for internal consistency were 0.82 for the children\u2019s report and 0.79 for the parental report. The ICCs were 0.90 and 0.89 for the total scores of the children and parental versions in the test-retest reliability analysis. The total SOHO-5 scores for both reports were significantly associated with the global rating questions except for the\u2019impact on children\u2019s general health\u2019 question in the parental report. Furthermore, the Myanmar version discriminated between the children with and without caries experiences (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study provided evidence that both children and parental reports of the Myanmar SOHO-5 version have good reliability and validity to assess the OHRQoL of 5-year-old children in a Burmese-speaking population.",
