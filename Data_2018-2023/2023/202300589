Here, we explored a Ca-EDTA combination with aztreonam or ceftazidime-avibactam in vitro and in vivo against diverse CPKp clinical isolates. The synergy testing of this study demonstrated that novel aztreonam-Ca-EDTA or ceftazidime-avibactam-Ca-EDTA combination was significantly effective in eliminating planktonic and mature biofilms in vitro, as well as eradicating CPKp infections in vivo. Both combinations revealed significant therapeutic efficacies in reducing bacterial load in internal organs and protecting treated mice from mortality. Conclusively, this is the first in vitro and in vivo study to demonstrate that novel aztreonam-Ca-EDTA or ceftazidime-avibactam-Ca-EDTA combinations provide favorable efficacy and safety for successful eradication of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae planktonic and biofilm infections.",

The sponsor(s) had no role in the study design; in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; or in the decision to submit the article for publication. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand (Certificate of approval (COA) No. 045/2020, IRB No. 774/63), and experiments were conducted in compliance with national and international ethical guidelines for human research as specified in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and its contemporary (2013) amendments, and comparable ethical standards including The Belmont Report, Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Guidelines, and International Conference on Harmonization in Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). For this retrospective study of anonymized clinical isolates, the requirement for informed consent from patients was waived by the IRB. All protocols involving animals (C57BL/6 mice) conformed to the revised guidelines of the U.S. Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Washington, DC: National Academy Press; 1996, and the Animals for Scientific Purposes Act, 2015 (BE 2558), and experiments were performed following the ethical standards as laid down in the Basel Declaration on the use of animals in research. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, approved the protocol (Certificate No. 033/2563, Research Project No. 020/2563) and protocols performed by operators licensed by the Thai Institute for Animals for Scientific Purpose Development and National Research Council of Thailand. The present article was prepared in compliance with the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines for reporting animal research.

Here, we explored a Ca-EDTA combination with aztreonam or ceftazidime-avibactam in vitro and in vivo against diverse CPKp clinical isolates. The synergy testing of this study demonstrated that novel aztreonam-Ca-EDTA or ceftazidime-avibactam-Ca-EDTA combination was significantly effective in eliminating planktonic and mature biofilms in vitro, as well as eradicating CPKp infections in vivo. Both combinations revealed significant therapeutic efficacies in reducing bacterial load in internal organs and protecting treated mice from mortality. Conclusively, this is the first in vitro and in vivo study to demonstrate that novel aztreonam-Ca-EDTA or ceftazidime-avibactam-Ca-EDTA combinations provide favorable efficacy and safety for successful eradication of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae planktonic and biofilm infections.",
