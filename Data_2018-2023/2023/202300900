Methods: A total of 103 patients (metastatic hormone-sensitive PC, n = 57; castration-resistant PC, n = 46) underwent taxane-based chemotherapy. All patients had a minimum of 2 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scans (at baseline and up to 3 mo after treatment). PSMA PET response was assessed by RECIST 1.1, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (using PSMA PET instead of bone scan), aPERCIST, and PSMA PET progression (PPP) criteria. Response by each criterion was stratified by either progressive disease (PD) or non-PD. For aPERCIST, stratification by PD, stable disease (SD), and partial/complete remission (PR/CR) was performed. Biochemical response was determined by a prostate-specific antigen decrease of at least 50%. Subgroup analyses were performed by castration status. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses including Harrell\u2019s concordance indices were calculated to investigate the association of PD by response criteria and OS. Kaplan\u2013Meier tests including log-rank statistics were calculated for survival analyses. Results: Twenty-six (25%) patients had unmeasurable disease by RECIST 1.1. PD by any response criterion was associated with an at least 2.5-fold increased risk of death and was highest for PD versus CR/PR by aPERCIST (hazard ratio, 11.4) on univariable regression. Stratified by castration status, a similar pattern was observed. PD by any criterion as associated with significantly shortened OS across overall and subgroup analyses. PR/CR by aPERCIST identified patients with lower risk of death and longer OS compared with patients with PD or SD. Conclusion: PSMA PET\u2013based response criteria (PPP, aPERCIST, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3) have high prognostic utility in men with metastatic PC undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy. PPP is simple to use, identified most patients with PD, and showed best prognostic utility regarding OS. PR/CR by aPERCIST identifies a subgroup of responders (PR/CR) showing better outcomes than patients with PD or SD. Future studies are warranted to amend the current paradigm relying on mere differentiation of PD versus non-PD in metastatic PC and to identify true treatment responders by imaging criteria.",

Methods: A total of 103 patients (metastatic hormone-sensitive PC, n = 57; castration-resistant PC, n = 46) underwent taxane-based chemotherapy. All patients had a minimum of 2 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scans (at baseline and up to 3 mo after treatment). PSMA PET response was assessed by RECIST 1.1, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (using PSMA PET instead of bone scan), aPERCIST, and PSMA PET progression (PPP) criteria. Response by each criterion was stratified by either progressive disease (PD) or non-PD. For aPERCIST, stratification by PD, stable disease (SD), and partial/complete remission (PR/CR) was performed. Biochemical response was determined by a prostate-specific antigen decrease of at least 50%. Subgroup analyses were performed by castration status. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses including Harrell\u2019s concordance indices were calculated to investigate the association of PD by response criteria and OS. Kaplan\u2013Meier tests including log-rank statistics were calculated for survival analyses. Results: Twenty-six (25%) patients had unmeasurable disease by RECIST 1.1. PD by any response criterion was associated with an at least 2.5-fold increased risk of death and was highest for PD versus CR/PR by aPERCIST (hazard ratio, 11.4) on univariable regression. Stratified by castration status, a similar pattern was observed. PD by any criterion as associated with significantly shortened OS across overall and subgroup analyses. PR/CR by aPERCIST identified patients with lower risk of death and longer OS compared with patients with PD or SD. Conclusion: PSMA PET\u2013based response criteria (PPP, aPERCIST, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3) have high prognostic utility in men with metastatic PC undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy. PPP is simple to use, identified most patients with PD, and showed best prognostic utility regarding OS. PR/CR by aPERCIST identifies a subgroup of responders (PR/CR) showing better outcomes than patients with PD or SD. Future studies are warranted to amend the current paradigm relying on mere differentiation of PD versus non-PD in metastatic PC and to identify true treatment responders by imaging criteria.",
