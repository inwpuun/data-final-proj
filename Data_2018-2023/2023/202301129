                "abstracts": "© 2023 The AuthorsIntroduction: The radiotherapy received by head and neck cancer patients commonly has adverse effects on oral tissue and the muscles of mastication. This short communication describes the digital fabrication of intraoral appliances for radiotherapy and muscle exercises. Methods: Three patients diagnosed with tongue squamous carcinoma were treatment-planned for radiotherapy using different radiation techniques. The patients were referred for oral scanning and digital bite records, and the appliance was collaboratively designed by a radiation oncologist, dentist, and laboratory technician. The appliance covered the occlusal surface of the remaining teeth with a 1-mm engagement. The lingual plate was 2-mm below the occlusal plane, and extended 4-mm distally, and the jaws were opened by 20-mm. The appliances were printed overnight using a rigid and biocompatible 3D printing material. Results: Requiring minimal chair-time, the appliance was easily inserted and adjusted to comfortably fit in the mouth. The patients were trained to insert it themselves. The tongue was at a pre-determined position during daily radiotherapy, and the healthy tissues were separated from the radiation field. The patients had mild adverse effects on their oral mucosa. Additionally, the appliances were used for muscle exercises after the radiation courses to prevent trismus. Conclusions: The interprofessional collaboration to fabricate customized intraoral appliances using digital workflow to maximize patients\u2019 benefits is feasible. Clinical significance: The use of intraoral appliances is potentially increased when the fabrication process is facilitated. Using an intraoral appliance precisely targets the tumor are for better treatment outcomes, and the healthy adjacent tissues will be preserved to maintain the patient's quality of life.",

        "dc:description": "Introduction: The radiotherapy received by head and neck cancer patients commonly has adverse effects on oral tissue and the muscles of mastication. This short communication describes the digital fabrication of intraoral appliances for radiotherapy and muscle exercises. Methods: Three patients diagnosed with tongue squamous carcinoma were treatment-planned for radiotherapy using different radiation techniques. The patients were referred for oral scanning and digital bite records, and the appliance was collaboratively designed by a radiation oncologist, dentist, and laboratory technician. The appliance covered the occlusal surface of the remaining teeth with a 1-mm engagement. The lingual plate was 2-mm below the occlusal plane, and extended 4-mm distally, and the jaws were opened by 20-mm. The appliances were printed overnight using a rigid and biocompatible 3D printing material. Results: Requiring minimal chair-time, the appliance was easily inserted and adjusted to comfortably fit in the mouth. The patients were trained to insert it themselves. The tongue was at a pre-determined position during daily radiotherapy, and the healthy tissues were separated from the radiation field. The patients had mild adverse effects on their oral mucosa. Additionally, the appliances were used for muscle exercises after the radiation courses to prevent trismus. Conclusions: The interprofessional collaboration to fabricate customized intraoral appliances using digital workflow to maximize patients\u2019 benefits is feasible. Clinical significance: The use of intraoral appliances is potentially increased when the fabrication process is facilitated. Using an intraoral appliance precisely targets the tumor are for better treatment outcomes, and the healthy adjacent tissues will be preserved to maintain the patient's quality of life.",
