                "abstracts": "© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Nickel-based catalysts are inexpensive and exhibit high catalytic activity; therefore, they have been extensively explored in deoxygenation reactions. Employing catalyst supports results in high product selectivity, and nitrogen-doped carbon has attracted significant interest as a catalyst support owing to the effect of nitrogen on the electronic properties. The present study demonstrated the synthesis of a Ni2P catalyst on melamine-doped carbon. The synthesized catalyst exhibited high deoxygenation activity, thereby facilitating the integrated catalytic upgradation and pyrolysis of palm kernel shells. Melamine-doped carbon was fabricated via carbonization of melamine-impregnated activated carbon. Subsequently, the Ni2P catalyst was loaded via sequential wet impregnation and temperature-programmed reduction. The presence of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) significantly affected the morphology and electronic properties of NixPy. Complexation between Ni and the N-containing functional groups on the carbon surface resulted in optimal distribution of the NixPy phase along the carbon support. Furthermore, electron transfer from the triazine structure to Ni substantially impacted the deoxygenation activity and the selectivity for aromatic and phenolic compounds. The outcomes of this study revealed that N-containing functional groups play a crucial role in optimizing the catalytic activity and the selective yield of alkylphenol products.",

        "dc:description": "Nickel-based catalysts are inexpensive and exhibit high catalytic activity; therefore, they have been extensively explored in deoxygenation reactions. Employing catalyst supports results in high product selectivity, and nitrogen-doped carbon has attracted significant interest as a catalyst support owing to the effect of nitrogen on the electronic properties. The present study demonstrated the synthesis of a Ni2P catalyst on melamine-doped carbon. The synthesized catalyst exhibited high deoxygenation activity, thereby facilitating the integrated catalytic upgradation and pyrolysis of palm kernel shells. Melamine-doped carbon was fabricated via carbonization of melamine-impregnated activated carbon. Subsequently, the Ni2P catalyst was loaded via sequential wet impregnation and temperature-programmed reduction. The presence of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) significantly affected the morphology and electronic properties of NixPy. Complexation between Ni and the N-containing functional groups on the carbon surface resulted in optimal distribution of the NixPy phase along the carbon support. Furthermore, electron transfer from the triazine structure to Ni substantially impacted the deoxygenation activity and the selectivity for aromatic and phenolic compounds. The outcomes of this study revealed that N-containing functional groups play a crucial role in optimizing the catalytic activity and the selective yield of alkylphenol products.",
