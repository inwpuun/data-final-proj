Not only did they sell their products to employees, but they also had an opportunity to sell to the dealer\u2019s customers. Moreover, Bang Rak Yai collaborated with other community-based enterprises from other provinces by joining the network of farmers\u2019 enterprises and by visiting other enterprises for exchanging ideas.

The variation of farmers\u2019 adaptation to urbanization results from urban expansion transforming local communities\u2019 environment and social structure. The patterns of farmers\u2019 adaptation can be categorized into the following: (1) reducing their production capacity; (2) establishing local groups to mobilize resources and manpower; and (3) changing their mode of production to other products and services. In addition, if urban expansion weakens local networks or participation from local communities, farmers hardly ever adapt themselves to new production modes or services. On the other hand, if urban expansion contributes to opportunities for farmers to collaborate with outside markets or external actors, the farmers can, to some extent, adapt their mode of production. The implication from this paper contributes to how policymakers can facilitate collaborative food governance system serving for specific needs of farmers, in particular peri-urban areas, and encourage positive environment between urban communities and farmers in peri-urban areas.",

The variation of farmers\u2019 adaptation to urbanization results from urban expansion transforming local communities\u2019 environment and social structure. The patterns of farmers\u2019 adaptation can be categorized into the following: (1) reducing their production capacity; (2) establishing local groups to mobilize resources and manpower; and (3) changing their mode of production to other products and services. In addition, if urban expansion weakens local networks or participation from local communities, farmers hardly ever adapt themselves to new production modes or services. On the other hand, if urban expansion contributes to opportunities for farmers to collaborate with outside markets or external actors, the farmers can, to some extent, adapt their mode of production. The implication from this paper contributes to how policymakers can facilitate collaborative food governance system serving for specific needs of farmers, in particular peri-urban areas, and encourage positive environment between urban communities and farmers in peri-urban areas.",
