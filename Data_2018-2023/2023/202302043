                "abstracts": "© 2023 International League Against Epilepsy.Objective: This study was undertaken to describe extracerebral biosignal characteristics of overall and various seizure types as compared with baseline physical activities using multimodal devices (Empatica E4); develop predictive models for overall and each seizure type; and assess diagnostic performance of each model. Methods: We prospectively recruited patients with focal epilepsy who were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for presurgical evaluation during January to December 2020. All study participants were simultaneously applied gold standard long-term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and an index test, E4. Two certified epileptologists independently determined whether captured events were seizures and then indicated ictal semiology and EEG information. Both were blind to multimodal biosignal findings detected by E4. Biosignals during 5-min epochs of both seizure events and baseline were collected and compared. Predictive models for occurrence overall and of each seizure type were developed using a generalized estimating equation. Diagnostic performance of each model was then assessed. Results: Thirty patients had events recorded and were recruited for analysis. One hundred eight seizure events and 120 baseline epochs were collected. Heart rate (HR), acceleration (ACC), and electrodermal activity (EDA) but not temperature were significantly elevated during seizures. Cluster analysis showed trends of greatest elevation of HR and ACC in bilateral tonic\u2013clonic seizures (BTCs), as compared with non-BTCs and isolated auras. HR and ACC were independent predictors for overall seizure types, BTCs, and non-BTCs, whereas only HR was a predictor for isolated aura. Diagnostic performance including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive model for overall seizures were 77.78%, 60%, and.696 (95% confidence interval =.628\u2013.764), respectively. Significance: Multimodal extracerebral biosignals (HR, ACC, EDA) detected by a wrist-worn smartwatch can help differentiate between epileptic seizures and normal physical activities. It would be worthwhile to implement our predictive algorithms in commercial seizure detection devices. However, larger studies to externally validate our predictive models are required.",

        "dc:description": "Objective: This study was undertaken to describe extracerebral biosignal characteristics of overall and various seizure types as compared with baseline physical activities using multimodal devices (Empatica E4); develop predictive models for overall and each seizure type; and assess diagnostic performance of each model. Methods: We prospectively recruited patients with focal epilepsy who were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for presurgical evaluation during January to December 2020. All study participants were simultaneously applied gold standard long-term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and an index test, E4. Two certified epileptologists independently determined whether captured events were seizures and then indicated ictal semiology and EEG information. Both were blind to multimodal biosignal findings detected by E4. Biosignals during 5-min epochs of both seizure events and baseline were collected and compared. Predictive models for occurrence overall and of each seizure type were developed using a generalized estimating equation. Diagnostic performance of each model was then assessed. Results: Thirty patients had events recorded and were recruited for analysis. One hundred eight seizure events and 120 baseline epochs were collected. Heart rate (HR), acceleration (ACC), and electrodermal activity (EDA) but not temperature were significantly elevated during seizures. Cluster analysis showed trends of greatest elevation of HR and ACC in bilateral tonic\u2013clonic seizures (BTCs), as compared with non-BTCs and isolated auras. HR and ACC were independent predictors for overall seizure types, BTCs, and non-BTCs, whereas only HR was a predictor for isolated aura. Diagnostic performance including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive model for overall seizures were 77.78%, 60%, and.696 (95% confidence interval =.628\u2013.764), respectively. Significance: Multimodal extracerebral biosignals (HR, ACC, EDA) detected by a wrist-worn smartwatch can help differentiate between epileptic seizures and normal physical activities. It would be worthwhile to implement our predictive algorithms in commercial seizure detection devices. However, larger studies to externally validate our predictive models are required.",
