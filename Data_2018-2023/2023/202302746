                "abstracts": "© 2022 Elsevier LtdIn this study, emergy analysis has been applied to evaluate and quantify the system performance in terms of natural resource utilization. The Emergy to Money Ratio (EMR) is the performance parameter to be optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to obtain the optimal use of available resources. A framework, so-called EMR-PSO, has been proposed to determine the minimum EMR, reflecting the low emergy investment with high system net profit. The system boundary consisted of four selected biomass and six alternative conversion processes. The framework was implemented in three scenarios covering feedstocks and product constraints. The optimization result indicated that, in the supply aspect, liquid fuel production from eucalyptus is the optimum solution in the case of normal operation. While eucalyptus availability was limited, Napier grass and PEFB were suggested as alternative substitutes. The minimum EMR from the production system in case of normal operation and high product demand with limited biomass availability were 2.04E+09 sej/$ and 6.77E+09 sej/$, v. Furthermore, the performance of the EMR-PSO was compared with other optimization techniques such as genetic algorithm (EMR-GA) and gradient-based method (EMR-GBM). The EMR-PSO was found to be superior to the others.",

                        "$": "GA is a popular method based on natural phenomena and relies on a randomized population search similar to PSO. The main difference between the two algorithms is the mechanism to generate a new solution population in each iteration. In GA, there are two main operations; cross-over and mutation. The survived population in the first iteration is selected based on the ranking of the fitness values. Then the offspring (newly generated population) are mutated from the cross-over operation of the parents from the previous iteration. This method tends to produce solutions for those gathering around the parent population. A small portion of solution diversification is obtained through the mutation operation. Still, the mutant is a solution generated from the initial population. For PSO, the solution is updated based on 3 terms; inertia, social, and cognitive (as discussed in Section 2.3). Each iteration can either enlarge or shrink the gap between the present and the previous solutions which makes PSO more diverse than GA. This property supports that the PSO converged faster than GA in this application.This research is financially supported by the Ratchadapisek Somphot Fund for Postdoctoral Fellowship and the Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University.

The Emergy to Money Ratio (EMR) is the performance parameter to be optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to obtain the optimal use of available resources. A framework, so-called EMR-PSO, has been proposed to determine the minimum EMR, reflecting the low emergy investment with high system net profit. The system boundary consisted of four selected biomass and six alternative conversion processes. The framework was implemented in three scenarios covering feedstocks and product constraints. The optimization result indicated that, in the supply aspect, liquid fuel production from eucalyptus is the optimum solution in the case of normal operation. While eucalyptus availability was limited, Napier grass and PEFB were suggested as alternative substitutes. The minimum EMR from the production system in case of normal operation and high product demand with limited biomass availability were 2.04E+09 sej/$ and 6.77E+09 sej/$, v. Furthermore, the performance of the EMR-PSO was compared with other optimization techniques such as genetic algorithm (EMR-GA) and gradient-based method (EMR-GBM). The EMR-PSO was found to be superior to the others.",
