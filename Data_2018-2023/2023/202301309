Movement Disorders Clinical Practice published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.Background: On-demand treatments can treat OFF episodes in Parkinson's disease, however, there is limited information regarding when to prescribe them. Objective: Develop expert consensus to determine appropriate clinical factors for considering on-demand treatments. Methods: Using a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi panel method, a panel developed consensus on the use of on-demand treatments for OFF episodes. Results: The panel agreed on-demand treatments were appropriate when OFF episodes were associated with greater functional impact and interfered with basic daily activities. The panel also agreed on-demand treatment may be appropriate for patients with morning akinesia and/or delayed ON of first levodopa dose and >1 type of OFF episode (eg, early morning OFF or wearing OFF regardless of frequency). Conclusions: Experts agreed on-demand treatment is appropriate for many patients with OFF episodes. The greater the functional impact of OFF episodes, the more likely experts agreed that on-demand treatment is appropriate to prescribe.",

Objective: Develop expert consensus to determine appropriate clinical factors for considering on-demand treatments. Methods: Using a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi panel method, a panel developed consensus on the use of on-demand treatments for OFF episodes. Results: The panel agreed on-demand treatments were appropriate when OFF episodes were associated with greater functional impact and interfered with basic daily activities. The panel also agreed on-demand treatment may be appropriate for patients with morning akinesia and/or delayed ON of first levodopa dose and >1 type of OFF episode (eg, early morning OFF or wearing OFF regardless of frequency). Conclusions: Experts agreed on-demand treatment is appropriate for many patients with OFF episodes. The greater the functional impact of OFF episodes, the more likely experts agreed that on-demand treatment is appropriate to prescribe.",
