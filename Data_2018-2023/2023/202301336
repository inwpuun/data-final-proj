                "abstracts": "© 2023 The Author(s)Objectives: The study aimed to compare the immunogenicity and safety of fractional (half) third doses of heterologous COVID-19 vaccines (AZD1222 or BNT162b2) to full doses after the two-dose CoronaVac and when boosting after three different extended intervals. Methods: At 60-<90, 90-<120, or 120-180 days intervals after the two-dose CoronaVac, participants were randomized to full-dose or half-dose AZD1222 or BNT162b2, followed up at day 28, 60, and 90. Vaccination-induced immune responses to Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 strains were evaluated by antispike, pseudovirus, and microneutralization and T cell assays. Descriptive statistics and noninferiority cut-offs were reported as geometric mean concentration or titer and concentration or titer ratios comparing baseline to day 28 and day 90 and different intervals. Results: No safety concerns were detected. All assays and intervals showed noninferior immunogenicity between full doses and half doses. However, full-dose vaccines and/or longer 120-180-day intervals substantially improved the immunogenicity (measured by antispike or measured by pseudotyped virus neutralizing titers 50; P <0.001). Seroconversion rates were over 90% against the SARS-CoV-2 strains by all assays. Immunogenicity waned more quickly with half doses than full doses but remained high against the Ancestral or Delta strains. Against Omicron, the day 28 immunogenicity increased with longer intervals than shorter intervals for full-dose vaccines. Conclusion: Immune responses after day 28 when boosting at longer intervals after the two-dose CoronaVac was optimal. Half doses met the noninferiority criteria compared with the full dose by all the immune assays assessed.",

        "dc:description": "Objectives: The study aimed to compare the immunogenicity and safety of fractional (half) third doses of heterologous COVID-19 vaccines (AZD1222 or BNT162b2) to full doses after the two-dose CoronaVac and when boosting after three different extended intervals. Methods: At 60-<90, 90-<120, or 120-180 days intervals after the two-dose CoronaVac, participants were randomized to full-dose or half-dose AZD1222 or BNT162b2, followed up at day 28, 60, and 90. Vaccination-induced immune responses to Ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 strains were evaluated by antispike, pseudovirus, and microneutralization and T cell assays. Descriptive statistics and noninferiority cut-offs were reported as geometric mean concentration or titer and concentration or titer ratios comparing baseline to day 28 and day 90 and different intervals. Results: No safety concerns were detected. All assays and intervals showed noninferior immunogenicity between full doses and half doses. However, full-dose vaccines and/or longer 120-180-day intervals substantially improved the immunogenicity (measured by antispike or measured by pseudotyped virus neutralizing titers 50; P <0.001). Seroconversion rates were over 90% against the SARS-CoV-2 strains by all assays. Immunogenicity waned more quickly with half doses than full doses but remained high against the Ancestral or Delta strains. Against Omicron, the day 28 immunogenicity increased with longer intervals than shorter intervals for full-dose vaccines. Conclusion: Immune responses after day 28 when boosting at longer intervals after the two-dose CoronaVac was optimal. Half doses met the noninferiority criteria compared with the full dose by all the immune assays assessed.",
