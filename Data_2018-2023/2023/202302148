The control group was given a single session of MCI knowledge, whereas the intervention group attended weekly art activities, based on visual thinking strategies, combined with cognitive development of aesthetic experience and contemplative arts for six weeks. There was no difference between the Thai Geriatric Depressive Scale (TGDS) scores or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores between the two groups. However, the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement of Quality of Life, compared to the control group (P<0.01), as did the letter fluency, delayed recall, and World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) scores (P<0.05). Famous paintings used in the study included: Painting Breathes Life into Sculpture, v.1, Snap the Whip, and The Hunters in the Snow (Winter).",

The control group was given a single session of MCI knowledge, whereas the intervention group attended weekly art activities, based on visual thinking strategies, combined with cognitive development of aesthetic experience and contemplative arts for six weeks. There was no difference between the Thai Geriatric Depressive Scale (TGDS) scores or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores between the two groups. However, the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement of Quality of Life, compared to the control group (P<0.01), as did the letter fluency, delayed recall, and World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) scores (P<0.05). Famous paintings used in the study included: Painting Breathes Life into Sculpture, v.1, Snap the Whip, and The Hunters in the Snow (Winter).",
