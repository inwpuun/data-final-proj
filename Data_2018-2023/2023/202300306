                "abstracts": "© 2023 by the authors.Background: Although exposure to chemical pesticides is known to cause negative effects on human health, farmers in Ban Luang, Nan, Thailand, continue to use them regularly to protect crops. This study focused on mothers who were engaged in farm tasks and had children between the ages of 0 to 72 months, with the objective of reducing pesticide exposure. Methods: This study was conducted from May 2020 to October 2020 in the Ban Fa and Ban Phi sub-districts in Ban Luang due to the high use of pesticides in these areas. A systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit 78 mothers exposed to pesticides. Thirty-nine mothers from Ban Fa district were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 39 from Ban Phi to the control group over a 3-month period. This study applied a pesticide behavioral change training program for the intervention group. To assess the effectiveness of the program, the study compared the results of a questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and health beliefs related to pesticide exposure as well as the levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BChE) enzymes, biomarkers of exposure to pesticides, before and after the intervention using ANCOVA statistical test. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention program, a paired t-test was used to investigate the in-home pesticide safety assessment. Results: After the intervention, we observed no significant change in AChE; however, a significant improvement in BChE (p < 0.05), a marker of short-term recovery, was observed. Pesticides can cause a reduction in AChE and BChE, however, after eliminating pesticides, BChE takes a shorter time (about 30\u201350 days) to recover than AChE (around 90\u2013120 days). Therefore, increases in the measured concentrations of AChE and/or BChE suggest the presence of less chemicals from pesticides in the human body. The study also found a significant improvement in KAP and beliefs about chemical pesticide exposure after the intervention (p < 0.05). Furthermore, using a paired t-test, we found a significant increase in pesticide safety practices (p < 0.05) in the intervention group and a borderline significant increase regarding in-home safety (p = 0.051) in the control group. Conclusions: Based on the results, the constructs of the intervention program were effective and could be applied in other agricultural areas in less developed countries. However, due to time limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic, further studies should be conducted to enable data collection over a longer time, with a larger number of subjects providing the ChE levels for the non-agricultural season.",

        "dc:description": "Background: Although exposure to chemical pesticides is known to cause negative effects on human health, farmers in Ban Luang, Nan, Thailand, continue to use them regularly to protect crops. This study focused on mothers who were engaged in farm tasks and had children between the ages of 0 to 72 months, with the objective of reducing pesticide exposure. Methods: This study was conducted from May 2020 to October 2020 in the Ban Fa and Ban Phi sub-districts in Ban Luang due to the high use of pesticides in these areas. A systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit 78 mothers exposed to pesticides. Thirty-nine mothers from Ban Fa district were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 39 from Ban Phi to the control group over a 3-month period. This study applied a pesticide behavioral change training program for the intervention group. To assess the effectiveness of the program, the study compared the results of a questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and health beliefs related to pesticide exposure as well as the levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BChE) enzymes, biomarkers of exposure to pesticides, before and after the intervention using ANCOVA statistical test. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention program, a paired t-test was used to investigate the in-home pesticide safety assessment. Results: After the intervention, we observed no significant change in AChE; however, a significant improvement in BChE (p < 0.05), a marker of short-term recovery, was observed. Pesticides can cause a reduction in AChE and BChE, however, after eliminating pesticides, BChE takes a shorter time (about 30\u201350 days) to recover than AChE (around 90\u2013120 days). Therefore, increases in the measured concentrations of AChE and/or BChE suggest the presence of less chemicals from pesticides in the human body. The study also found a significant improvement in KAP and beliefs about chemical pesticide exposure after the intervention (p < 0.05). Furthermore, using a paired t-test, we found a significant increase in pesticide safety practices (p < 0.05) in the intervention group and a borderline significant increase regarding in-home safety (p = 0.051) in the control group. Conclusions: Based on the results, the constructs of the intervention program were effective and could be applied in other agricultural areas in less developed countries. However, due to time limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic, further studies should be conducted to enable data collection over a longer time, with a larger number of subjects providing the ChE levels for the non-agricultural season.",
