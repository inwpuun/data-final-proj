                "abstracts": "© 2023 The AuthorsBackground: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been affecting people globally, and the Philippines is one of the countries greatly struck by the virus. The continued rise of new positive cases has drawn attention to the urgent need for healthcare management to cope with this challenge. Severity prediction could help improve medical decision-making and optimise the patient's treatment plan with a good clinical outcome. This study aimed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Demographic characteristics and laboratory findings were collected from electronic medical records and paper forms of all confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the University of Perpetual Help DALTA Medical Center between the September 1, 2020 and the October 31, 2021. We performed statistical analyses and interpretation of data to compare severe and non-severe groups. Results: 5,396 confirmed cases were examined. Most of the severe cases were elderly, male, had blood type A, and with comorbidities. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were lower in the severe group. Most patients had higher-than-normal levels of all blood parameters except platelet, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts. Age, sex, ABO blood groups, comorbidities, open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) gene Ct values, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count were significantly associated with disease severity. In multivariate analysis, age groups >60 and 30\u201359 years, presence of comorbidities, CRP level >5 ng/mL, and PCT >0.05 ng/mL were identified as disease severity predictors. Conclusions: Based on our results, age, comorbidities, CRP, and PCT level may be utilised as primary assessment factors for possible hospital admission and close monitoring upon testing. Early detection of these risk factors may provide strategic interventions that help reduce mortality, hospital admissions, and more expensive and extensive treatments.",

        "dc:description": "Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been affecting people globally, and the Philippines is one of the countries greatly struck by the virus. The continued rise of new positive cases has drawn attention to the urgent need for healthcare management to cope with this challenge. Severity prediction could help improve medical decision-making and optimise the patient's treatment plan with a good clinical outcome. This study aimed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Demographic characteristics and laboratory findings were collected from electronic medical records and paper forms of all confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the University of Perpetual Help DALTA Medical Center between the September 1, 2020 and the October 31, 2021. We performed statistical analyses and interpretation of data to compare severe and non-severe groups. Results: 5,396 confirmed cases were examined. Most of the severe cases were elderly, male, had blood type A, and with comorbidities. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were lower in the severe group. Most patients had higher-than-normal levels of all blood parameters except platelet, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts. Age, sex, ABO blood groups, comorbidities, open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) gene Ct values, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count were significantly associated with disease severity. In multivariate analysis, age groups >60 and 30\u201359 years, presence of comorbidities, CRP level >5 ng/mL, and PCT >0.05 ng/mL were identified as disease severity predictors. Conclusions: Based on our results, age, comorbidities, CRP, and PCT level may be utilised as primary assessment factors for possible hospital admission and close monitoring upon testing. Early detection of these risk factors may provide strategic interventions that help reduce mortality, hospital admissions, and more expensive and extensive treatments.",
