Nonetheless, under environmental volatility, the impact of organization agility and organization flexibility on performance on each type of product innovation (radical and incremental innovation) is not fully understood. Drawing from the concept of dynamic capabilities, using survey research, and analyzing data with regression analysis, the results show that environmental volatility strengthens a relationship between organization agility and radical innovation performance. However, environmental volatility weakens a relationship between organization flexibility and radical innovation performance. Lastly, the role of environmental volatility does not appear in case of incremental innovation. We expect that this study extends the concept of dynamic capabilities and sheds light on diverse effects between organization agility and flexibility for each type of product innovation under environmental volatility.
