All rights reserved.The objective of this research is to manage waste glass in Koh Sichang, Chonburi province, used as a partial fine aggregate replacement in concrete brick production. An experimental approach aimed to determine the level of waste glass replacement for the optimal compressive strength. Five samples of 0, 10, 20, 30, and 100% waste glass aggregates by weight were tested at 7, 14, and 28 days. The microstructure and mineralogical phases of the concrete bricks were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry, respectively. The experimental results showed that the compressive strength was improved by increments in replacing waste glass up to 20%; in contrast, the compressive strength was decreased with an increase of waste glass of over 20% in concrete bricks. The optimum compressive strength of concrete brick was 20% by weight, which had the highest values (46.51, 47.41, and 48.49 MPa at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively) and the lowest water absorption. Therefore, waste glass can be used as a partial fine aggregate for producing concrete bricks, and it can be employed as an alternative material for waste glass management.",

An experimental approach aimed to determine the level of waste glass replacement for the optimal compressive strength. Five samples of 0, 10, 20, 30, and 100% waste glass aggregates by weight were tested at 7, 14, and 28 days. The microstructure and mineralogical phases of the concrete bricks were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry, respectively. The experimental results showed that the compressive strength was improved by increments in replacing waste glass up to 20%; in contrast, the compressive strength was decreased with an increase of waste glass of over 20% in concrete bricks. The optimum compressive strength of concrete brick was 20% by weight, which had the highest values (46.51, 47.41, and 48.49 MPa at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively) and the lowest water absorption. Therefore, waste glass can be used as a partial fine aggregate for producing concrete bricks, and it can be employed as an alternative material for waste glass management.",
