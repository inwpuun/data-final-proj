                "abstracts": "© 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Occupational Hygiene Society.Objectives: Previous epidemiological evidence for the association of shift work exposure and increased leukocyte count is cross-sectional in nature, thus limiting cause-effect inference. We therefore used a longitudinal design to: (i) compare leukocyte counts at baseline between shift and day workers and (ii) examine the time trend of leukocyte counts over the follow-up period for these workers. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 6737 workers aged <60 years at two large organizations (a humanitarian organization and a university) in Bangkok, Thailand who had participated in at least two annual health check-ups during the period 2005-2016. Shift work exposure history was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire and categorized into day, former, and current shift workers. Data on leukocyte count were collected annually as part of worksite health screening during the observation period. Association of shift work exposure and increased leukocyte count was then examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally by using multiple linear regression and multilevel analysis of repeated measures data, respectively. In addition, trends for leukocyte count over the follow-up period and work years were examined using LOWESS smooth curves. Results: Compared to day work, the current shift work was associated with increased leukocyte counts. The magnitude of percentage increase was the highest for basophil counts, followed by eosinophil and lymphocyte counts. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence revealed this association, although it was less pronounced longitudinally. For total leukocyte count, the magnitude of difference was constant across the 11-year follow-up period. However, for lymphocyte and basophil counts, these discrepancies tapered over the work years until they no longer differed (for lymphocyte count) or even differed in the opposite direction (for basophil count) in later work years. Conclusion: This study confirmed previous cross-sectional evidence that shift work exposure-increased leukocyte counts and that this was reversible. Whether this increase in immune cell count also results in an increased immune cell activity and serves as the intermediary in the association between shift work exposure and subsequent chronic disease development needs further investigation.",

        "dc:description": "Objectives: Previous epidemiological evidence for the association of shift work exposure and increased leukocyte count is cross-sectional in nature, thus limiting cause-effect inference. We therefore used a longitudinal design to: (i) compare leukocyte counts at baseline between shift and day workers and (ii) examine the time trend of leukocyte counts over the follow-up period for these workers. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 6737 workers aged <60 years at two large organizations (a humanitarian organization and a university) in Bangkok, Thailand who had participated in at least two annual health check-ups during the period 2005-2016. Shift work exposure history was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire and categorized into day, former, and current shift workers. Data on leukocyte count were collected annually as part of worksite health screening during the observation period. Association of shift work exposure and increased leukocyte count was then examined cross-sectionally and longitudinally by using multiple linear regression and multilevel analysis of repeated measures data, respectively. In addition, trends for leukocyte count over the follow-up period and work years were examined using LOWESS smooth curves. Results: Compared to day work, the current shift work was associated with increased leukocyte counts. The magnitude of percentage increase was the highest for basophil counts, followed by eosinophil and lymphocyte counts. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence revealed this association, although it was less pronounced longitudinally. For total leukocyte count, the magnitude of difference was constant across the 11-year follow-up period. However, for lymphocyte and basophil counts, these discrepancies tapered over the work years until they no longer differed (for lymphocyte count) or even differed in the opposite direction (for basophil count) in later work years. Conclusion: This study confirmed previous cross-sectional evidence that shift work exposure-increased leukocyte counts and that this was reversible. Whether this increase in immune cell count also results in an increased immune cell activity and serves as the intermediary in the association between shift work exposure and subsequent chronic disease development needs further investigation.",
