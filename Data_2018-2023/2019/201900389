This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Measles and rubella are highly contagious viral diseases transmitted via respiratory secretions and aerosolized droplets. Thailand has implemented universal vaccination against measles using the monovalent measles (M) or the trivalent measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for the past 30 years. Nevertheless, incidence of measles and rubella remains in some parts of the country. We conducted a seroprevalence study to evaluate the antibodies to measles and rubella virus among Thais of all ages and to determine pre-existing immunity resulting from either vaccination and/or natural exposure. A total of 1,781 serum samples collected in 2014 was tested for IgG to measles and rubella virus by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Percentages of individuals with protective antibody levels and the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of IgG in each age group were analysed. The GMC of anti-measles IgG and anti-rubella IgG were 653.7 IU/L (95% confidence interval (CI); 555.9\u2013751.4) and 39.5 IU/mL (95% CI;35.0\u201343.9), respectively. Thais between the ages of six months and 25 years did not demonstrate sufficient protective herd immunity for measles. This observation is consistent with the recent measles outbreaks in this age group. Lower prevalence of immunity against rubella was found among children ages 5\u20136 years who may not have completed vaccination as infants. Our findings identify gaps in rubella and measles immunity in specific age groups and support recommendations for catch-up MMR vaccination in individuals 30 years of age or younger.",

        "dc:description": "Measles and rubella are highly contagious viral diseases transmitted via respiratory secretions and aerosolized droplets. Thailand has implemented universal vaccination against measles using the monovalent measles (M) or the trivalent measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for the past 30 years. Nevertheless, incidence of measles and rubella remains in some parts of the country. We conducted a seroprevalence study to evaluate the antibodies to measles and rubella virus among Thais of all ages and to determine pre-existing immunity resulting from either vaccination and/or natural exposure. A total of 1,781 serum samples collected in 2014 was tested for IgG to measles and rubella virus by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Percentages of individuals with protective antibody levels and the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of IgG in each age group were analysed. The GMC of anti-measles IgG and anti-rubella IgG were 653.7 IU/L (95% confidence interval (CI); 555.9\u2013751.4) and 39.5 IU/mL (95% CI;35.0\u201343.9), respectively. Thais between the ages of six months and 25 years did not demonstrate sufficient protective herd immunity for measles. This observation is consistent with the recent measles outbreaks in this age group. Lower prevalence of immunity against rubella was found among children ages 5\u20136 years who may not have completed vaccination as infants. Our findings identify gaps in rubella and measles immunity in specific age groups and support recommendations for catch-up MMR vaccination in individuals 30 years of age or younger.",
