Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand have been conducting multicultural PBL titled \u2018\u2018Global Awareness for Technology Implementation in the Solving of Global Issues\u2019\u2019 since 2015. The program is composed of online group work in remote setting, and both-ways visits to and from Japan and Thailand. This paper discusses in detail trend and characteristics of motivation and learning outcomes of multicultural PBL for students from Tokyo Institute of Technology and Chulalongkorn University. In so doing, this paper summarizes (1) process of Multicultural PBL, (2) functions and roles of on-line tools for communication for program implementation, and (3) result of comparative analysis. For comparative analysis, following methods were utilized; (1) pre and post survey using Likert scale, (2) content analysis using personal essays, and (3) participants observation. Based on the multicultural PBL\u2019s objectives, five indicator-categories namely (1) global awareness, (2) multicultural understanding, (3) multicultural teamwork, (4) critical thinking, and (5) technology implementation are set. Several finding which are common to students from both universities for both years were observed. First, it was found out that students had high interests on going abroad before they join the program. Second, students are interested in advanced countries. Third, even before joining the multicultural PBL, students have realized the importance of respecting cultural differences. Forth, before the program, they are not yet prepared for finding solution for social issues, as wells as methods of technology localization/implementation. Fifth, after joining the multicultural PBL, students have increased understanding of cultural differences and knowledge on the topics related to two countries. Sixth, students kept high motivation to visit abroad and high interest on advanced countries from the beginning until the end of the multicultural PBL. By assessing the motivation and learning outcome of the students from two universities in Japan and Thailand, this paper also summarized the lessons learnt and key for the success in implementing multicultural PBL.",

        "dc:description": "The purpose of this paper is to determine trend and characteristics of engineering students\u2019 motivation and learning outcome of multicultural project-based learning (PBL) between two universities in Japan and Thailand. Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand have been conducting multicultural PBL titled \u2018\u2018Global Awareness for Technology Implementation in the Solving of Global Issues\u2019\u2019 since 2015. The program is composed of online group work in remote setting, and both-ways visits to and from Japan and Thailand. This paper discusses in detail trend and characteristics of motivation and learning outcomes of multicultural PBL for students from Tokyo Institute of Technology and Chulalongkorn University. In so doing, this paper summarizes (1) process of Multicultural PBL, (2) functions and roles of on-line tools for communication for program implementation, and (3) result of comparative analysis. For comparative analysis, following methods were utilized; (1) pre and post survey using Likert scale, (2) content analysis using personal essays, and (3) participants observation. Based on the multicultural PBL\u2019s objectives, five indicator-categories namely (1) global awareness, (2) multicultural understanding, (3) multicultural teamwork, (4) critical thinking, and (5) technology implementation are set. Several finding which are common to students from both universities for both years were observed. First, it was found out that students had high interests on going abroad before they join the program. Second, students are interested in advanced countries. Third, even before joining the multicultural PBL, students have realized the importance of respecting cultural differences. Forth, before the program, they are not yet prepared for finding solution for social issues, as wells as methods of technology localization/implementation. Fifth, after joining the multicultural PBL, students have increased understanding of cultural differences and knowledge on the topics related to two countries. Sixth, students kept high motivation to visit abroad and high interest on advanced countries from the beginning until the end of the multicultural PBL. By assessing the motivation and learning outcome of the students from two universities in Japan and Thailand, this paper also summarized the lessons learnt and key for the success in implementing multicultural PBL.",
