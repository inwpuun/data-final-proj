                "abstracts": "© 2018 Elsevier LtdThe prototype system of integrated anaerobic filter with condenser of air conditioner (anaerobic filter-condenser; ANCO) was developed for sustainable water-energy management model in green office building. The ANCO consists of an insulated anaerobic filter (IAF) and condenser that are connected to an existing refrigerant of air conditioner. The system applied waste heat energy from an air conditioner to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. While the performance of air conditioner also could be enhanced by decreasing refrigerant temperature from transferring waste heat through the IAF system for increasing wastewater temperature. The waste heat from air conditioner could stimulate higher microbial activity in the IAF and at the same time, this could increase air conditioner performance. From the overall results, it was found that with wastewater flow rate 180 liter/day, the ANCO prototype could recycle waste heat approximately 2.82 kWh/day. The waste heat transferred into wastewater could increase water temperature up to averagely 35.4 °C. The system performance for removal of suspended solids (SS) and COD were averagely 49.9% and 49.3%, respectively. The coefficient of performance (COPOverall) of air conditioner was increased by 30.25% and electric consumption was decreased by 22.96%. The ANCO system could save electrical energy averagely 2.62 kWh/day. Then, the ANCO system can decrease heat into environment and decrease greenhouse gas emission 602 kgCO2eq/year. Therefore, the ANCO system was pronounced to be the prototype eco-friendly onsite-wastewater treatment system for green office building application.",

        "dc:description": "The prototype system of integrated anaerobic filter with condenser of air conditioner (anaerobic filter-condenser; ANCO) was developed for sustainable water-energy management model in green office building. The ANCO consists of an insulated anaerobic filter (IAF) and condenser that are connected to an existing refrigerant of air conditioner. The system applied waste heat energy from an air conditioner to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. While the performance of air conditioner also could be enhanced by decreasing refrigerant temperature from transferring waste heat through the IAF system for increasing wastewater temperature. The waste heat from air conditioner could stimulate higher microbial activity in the IAF and at the same time, this could increase air conditioner performance. From the overall results, it was found that with wastewater flow rate 180 liter/day, the ANCO prototype could recycle waste heat approximately 2.82 kWh/day. The waste heat transferred into wastewater could increase water temperature up to averagely 35.4 °C. The system performance for removal of suspended solids (SS) and COD were averagely 49.9% and 49.3%, respectively. The coefficient of performance (COPOverall) of air conditioner was increased by 30.25% and electric consumption was decreased by 22.96%. The ANCO system could save electrical energy averagely 2.62 kWh/day. Then, the ANCO system can decrease heat into environment and decrease greenhouse gas emission 602 kgCO2eq/year. Therefore, the ANCO system was pronounced to be the prototype eco-friendly onsite-wastewater treatment system for green office building application.",
