Nitrate has no taste and odorless in water and can be detected by chemical test only. It was reported that Suphan Buri is considered as one of the provinces with intensive agricultural areas, especially sugarcane fields. In this study, NO3- concentrations were measured in 8 groundwater wells located in sugarcane fields in this province. NO3- concentration in the area was ranged from 2.39 to 68.19 mg/L with an average concentration of 30.49 mg/L which was a bit higher than the previous study by Department of Groundwater Resources or DGR, which found that NO3- was in the range of 0.53-66 mg/L with an average concentration of 24.15 mg/L. Moreover, there were two groundwater samples, which were found NO3- concentration higher than the Thailand groundwater drinking standard (45 mg/L). As a result, NO3- contaminated groundwater is common in the area with intensive use of nitrogen fertilizers and agricultural activities. People especially infants and babies living around the area have a chance to have health risks from NO3- by drinking and using water from the wells.",

Nitrate has no taste and odorless in water and can be detected by chemical test only. It was reported that Suphan Buri is considered as one of the provinces with intensive agricultural areas, especially sugarcane fields. In this study, NO3- concentrations were measured in 8 groundwater wells located in sugarcane fields in this province. NO3- concentration in the area was ranged from 2.39 to 68.19 mg/L with an average concentration of 30.49 mg/L which was a bit higher than the previous study by Department of Groundwater Resources or DGR, which found that NO3- was in the range of 0.53-66 mg/L with an average concentration of 24.15 mg/L. Moreover, there were two groundwater samples, which were found NO3- concentration higher than the Thailand groundwater drinking standard (45 mg/L). As a result, NO3- contaminated groundwater is common in the area with intensive use of nitrogen fertilizers and agricultural activities. People especially infants and babies living around the area have a chance to have health risks from NO3- by drinking and using water from the wells.",
