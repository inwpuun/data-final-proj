                "abstracts": "© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In petroleum industries, waxy crude oil is normally found in petroleum production. Wax formation and precipitation during pipeline transport of waxy crude oils can cause several challenges, including wax deposition and flow reduction which adversely impacts pipeline performance in oil and gas production. To overcome the wax deposition problem, the small amount of chemicals like wax inhibitors can provide an effective preventative measure. One of this mechanism is to reduce the pour point temperature. In this work, oil from Sirikit Oilfield in Thailand is selected for this study. The wax inhibitors are selected and studied the performance for pour-point reduction. These chemicals are Polyalkyl methacrylate (PAMA), Poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecane) (PMAO), Polyalkyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol (PAMAEG) and Copolymers of maleic anhydride (CPMA) with the concentration ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm. Also, n-pentane with the concentration of 5-20 % by weight is used as a solvent for wax inhibitors. The results from this study show that n-pentane can reduce the pour point to 39.41 % compared to the original oil. Furthermore, among the polymer group, PMAO can reduce the lowest pour point to 52.82 %. In addition, the mixed solvents of polymer with n-pentane can provide relatively less effect on pour-point reduction. The mixture of n-pentane with PMAO can lower the pour point to a certain level of 54.96 % compared to the original oil. This study can be applied to use in the real field to prevent wax deposition in the pipeline transportation for oil production.",

        "dc:description": "In petroleum industries, waxy crude oil is normally found in petroleum production. Wax formation and precipitation during pipeline transport of waxy crude oils can cause several challenges, including wax deposition and flow reduction which adversely impacts pipeline performance in oil and gas production. To overcome the wax deposition problem, the small amount of chemicals like wax inhibitors can provide an effective preventative measure. One of this mechanism is to reduce the pour point temperature. In this work, oil from Sirikit Oilfield in Thailand is selected for this study. The wax inhibitors are selected and studied the performance for pour-point reduction. These chemicals are Polyalkyl methacrylate (PAMA), Poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecane) (PMAO), Polyalkyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol (PAMAEG) and Copolymers of maleic anhydride (CPMA) with the concentration ranging from 100 to 1000 ppm. Also, n-pentane with the concentration of 5-20 % by weight is used as a solvent for wax inhibitors. The results from this study show that n-pentane can reduce the pour point to 39.41 % compared to the original oil. Furthermore, among the polymer group, PMAO can reduce the lowest pour point to 52.82 %. In addition, the mixed solvents of polymer with n-pentane can provide relatively less effect on pour-point reduction. The mixture of n-pentane with PMAO can lower the pour point to a certain level of 54.96 % compared to the original oil. This study can be applied to use in the real field to prevent wax deposition in the pipeline transportation for oil production.",
