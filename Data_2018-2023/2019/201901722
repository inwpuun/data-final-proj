The objective of this study is to find out the factors that significantly affect the CBHI enrollment incentive. The study applied cross-sectional study design to perform situation analysis, in which the Andersen behavioral model was used as a guideline to identify preliminary characteristics that involved with enrolling incentive. Findings: The model found that existence of both outpatient department (OPD) and inpatient department (IPD) health service utilization had significant impact on the CBHI enrollment, this statement is strongly related to adverse selection issues. Households resides in Kaysone Phomvihane district had higher probability of joining the scheme in comparison with relatively less-developed Champhone district. Households with no CBHI knowledge were also more likely to enroll the scheme. Occupation was also found to be a significant factors; of which farmers and laborers had lower possibility enrollment. Conclusions: Economic condition of the district has a significant impact on enrolment. However, the increase in personal income does not directly enhance the desire for enrolment. Most of the high-income households prefer to use a local, private clinic, and foreign hospitals in Thailand or Vietnam. Households with unemployed heads had the highest possibility of enrolling. The reason is the unemployed respondents include the elderly who stay at home without performing major tasks in exchange for their living. That group of people has the highest probability of either OPD or IPD.",

The objective of this study is to find out the factors that significantly affect the CBHI enrollment incentive. The study applied cross-sectional study design to perform situation analysis, in which the Andersen behavioral model was used as a guideline to identify preliminary characteristics that involved with enrolling incentive. Findings: The model found that existence of both outpatient department (OPD) and inpatient department (IPD) health service utilization had significant impact on the CBHI enrollment, this statement is strongly related to adverse selection issues. Households resides in Kaysone Phomvihane district had higher probability of joining the scheme in comparison with relatively less-developed Champhone district. Households with no CBHI knowledge were also more likely to enroll the scheme. Occupation was also found to be a significant factors; of which farmers and laborers had lower possibility enrollment. Conclusions: Economic condition of the district has a significant impact on enrolment. However, the increase in personal income does not directly enhance the desire for enrolment. Most of the high-income households prefer to use a local, private clinic, and foreign hospitals in Thailand or Vietnam. Households with unemployed heads had the highest possibility of enrolling. The reason is the unemployed respondents include the elderly who stay at home without performing major tasks in exchange for their living. That group of people has the highest probability of either OPD or IPD.",
