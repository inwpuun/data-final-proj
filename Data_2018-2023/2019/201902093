                {"$": "This work was funded by Chulalongkorn University, Government budget grant. After responding to an advertisement posted at the university and the nearby community, 45 participants (21 males, 24 females) between the ages of 18 to 50 met the inclusion criteria. A nurse and a registered dietitian screened participants for the inclusion criteria which included non-smoking; consumption of a regular breakfast: healthy teeth (a full set of healthy teeth); no food allergies; no eating disorders; less than 2-kg weight alteration over the past 3 months and no consumption of any medications or dietary supplements that may confound any study indicators. Eligible participants were divided into two groups (lean and overweight) according to their body mass index (BMI) (lean BMI (kg/m2) ? 18.5 and < 23, overweight BMI ? 23). Forty-one participants (17 males, 24 females) completed the study protocol. On the morning of the study day, anthropometry data for each participant was collected. BMI was calculated as weight/height (in kilograms per square meter). Waist and hip circumferences were measured to the nearest 1.0 cm using a standard rounded tape at a point right above the iliac crest on the mid-axillary line at minimal respiration (for waist) and in a horizontal plane at the level of the maximal extension of the buttocks (for hip). All procedures involving human participants were approved by the Ethical Review Committee for Research Involving Human Research Subjects, Health Science Group, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrolment in the study. The anonymity of the participants was preserved. The Clinical Trial number was NCT03342313 (Clinicaltrial.gov). Phase I: investigate the differences in chewing activities between healthy weight and overweight participants. In Phase I, the day before the clinic visit, participants were requested to consume only fried rice with egg ad libitum for their dinner between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. No other food or drinks were allowed after the provided dinner. The next morning, participants arrived at the clinic between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. after a 12-hour overnight fast and a 24-hour period without exercise. A ham and cheese on white bread sandwich, which was the subjects? usual breakfast, with percentage caloric distributions of carbohydrate, protein and fat of 33.80, 7.82 and 48.38, respectively, was served with 300 mL of water for breakfast ad libitum. Each participant received a sandwich (110 g, 145 kcal) ad libitum in a separated room on a clinic day according to their appointment. Weight of the food consumed was recorded. A digital camera was positioned 2 m (face on) from the participants to record participant chewing activities, including meal time (minutes); timing at the first bite until the end of the last bite, bite size (gram/bite); weight of food eaten divided by bite number; bite rate (bite/minutes); bite number divided by minutes of meal time, chewing frequency (chews/minutes); chewing number divided by minute of meal time, chews (chews/g) and chewing number divided by gram of food eaten. The videos were interpreted by three researchers independently. The inter-observer reliability was examined using intraclass correlation (ICC). The results showed that ICC for all measurements was reliable (ICC ? 0.90). Participants were informed that the objective of the present study was to examine the effect of solid food on postprandial blood glucose. The results show that the maximum and minimum number of chews per bite was 50 and 15 (mean ? SD, 50.80 ? 15.24, 13.95 ? 5.03 chews per bite, respectively). The average number of chews was rounded up for convenience and used as a factor in Phase II of the study. Phase II: investigate the effects of chew number on energy intake, hunger, satiety, appetite, postprandial plasma glucose levels and insulin levels in both healthy weight and overweight participants. In this randomised cross-over design study, participants were separated into two groups (15 chews/bite and 50 chews/bite) with 2 weeks of a wash-out period. The day before the clinic visit, participants were requested to consume only fried rice with egg ad libitum for their dinner between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. No other foods or drinks were allowed after the provided dinner to prevent confounding factors of previous food consumption. The next day, participants arrived at the clinic between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. after a 12-hour overnight fast and a 24-hour period without exercise. At the clinic, baseline characteristics including anthropometry, hunger, satiety, appetite and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were collected before breakfast was served. Each participant was asked to rate their hunger, satiety and appetite using a visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire developed by Hill and Blundell. Each VAS questionnaire was 100 mm in length and contained labels ranging from ?not at all? (score of 0) to ?extremely? (score of 10). After collection of baseline parameters, participants were served an ad libitum ham and cheese sandwich and 300-mL water for breakfast. In order to control for bite size, a sandwich was cut into pieces of 7 g each (an average bite size of lean and overweight participants results from Phase I study) before served. Participants were required to finish their breakfast within 20 minutes after the first bite. The VAS questionnaire and blood samples of postprandial glucose and insulin were examined at 0 (baseline) 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the test meal. Blood was collected using indwelling catheters at specified time points and immediately centrifuged at 2500 ? g at 4?C for 15 minutes. Aliquots of plasma were separated and frozen at ?20?C until glucose and insulin concentration analysis. Plasma glucose concentration was determined by the glucose oxidase method using an auto-analyser. Plasma insulin was determined using a chemiluminescence method at a Health Sciences service unit, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. Additionally, the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was measured as fasting serum insulin (?IU/mL) ? fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5. Energy intake was calculated using the plate waste (the mass of the food served minus the mass of the food left over). A digital camera recorded the number of chews per bite for each participant to endorse study compliance. Four participants (lean = 2, overweight =2) were excluded since they did not comply with the chewing number requirement of 15 and 50 times before swallowing according to the study protocol in Phase II. All data of these four participants were excluded from analysis. All data are presented as the mean ? SD. Student's t-tests were applied to determine differences between the means for baseline characteristics and chewing activities variables. Energy intake data was analysed by two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) (status ? chewing). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule to quantify the overall response to chewing. Postprandial plasma glucose levels, insulin levels and the AUC of the different tests were compared using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A total sample size of 14 participants in both lean and overweight groups would provide 80% power to detect significant differences of chewing on energy intake in lean and overweight participants. Differences were considered as statistically significant at a probability value (P value) of less than 0.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS, version 16.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).

                "abstracts": "© 2018 Dietitians Association of AustraliaAim: This randomised cross-over design study aimed to investigate different chewing activities between healthy weight and overweight individuals and to determine the effect of chewing on energy intake and postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Methods: Forty-one participants were classified into healthy weight and overweight groups according to body mass index (BMI). In Phase I, bite size (g/bite), bite rate (bites/minutes), chewing frequency (chews/minutes) and chews (chews/g food) were recorded after a sandwich breakfast. In Phase II, the mass of a sandwich consumed after 15 and 50 chews per bite (results of Phase I) was recorded. Postprandial plasma glucose and insulin were also examined at 0 (baseline), 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes. Results: The results showed that the number of chews per bite was higher in lean participants as compared to overweight participants. Energy intake was highest in overweight participants who chewed 15 times per bite. Additionally, participants consumed less energy after 50 chews regardless of their BMI status. The results also demonstrated that 50 chews per bite insignificantly increased plasma insulin concentrations at every time point in both lean and obese subjects. Insulin concentrations were not significantly changed at each time point regardless of the number of chews. Conclusions: Overweight participants chewed less and ingested more calories. Chewing 50 times per bite could reduce caloric intake regardless of weight status, suggesting that slow eating via increased chewing may help to reduce energy intake during meals. However, chewing did not affect postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels in healthy young adults.",

                        "$": "This work was funded by Chulalongkorn University, Government budget grant. After responding to an advertisement posted at the university and the nearby community, 45 participants (21 males, 24 females) between the ages of 18 to 50 met the inclusion criteria. A nurse and a registered dietitian screened participants for the inclusion criteria which included non-smoking; consumption of a regular breakfast: healthy teeth (a full set of healthy teeth); no food allergies; no eating disorders; less than 2-kg weight alteration over the past 3 months and no consumption of any medications or dietary supplements that may confound any study indicators. Eligible participants were divided into two groups (lean and overweight) according to their body mass index (BMI) (lean BMI (kg/m2) ≥ 18.5 and < 23, overweight BMI ≥ 23). Forty-one participants (17 males, 24 females) completed the study protocol. On the morning of the study day, anthropometry data for each participant was collected. BMI was calculated as weight/height (in kilograms per square meter). Waist and hip circumferences were measured to the nearest 1.0 cm using a standard rounded tape at a point right above the iliac crest on the mid-axillary line at minimal respiration (for waist) and in a horizontal plane at the level of the maximal extension of the buttocks (for hip). All procedures involving human participants were approved by the Ethical Review Committee for Research Involving Human Research Subjects, Health Science Group, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrolment in the study. The anonymity of the participants was preserved. The Clinical Trial number was NCT03342313 (Clinicaltrial.gov). Phase I: investigate the differences in chewing activities between healthy weight and overweight participants. In Phase I, the day before the clinic visit, participants were requested to consume only fried rice with egg ad libitum for their dinner between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. No other food or drinks were allowed after the provided dinner. The next morning, participants arrived at the clinic between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. after a 12-hour overnight fast and a 24-hour period without exercise. A ham and cheese on white bread sandwich, which was the subjects\u2019 usual breakfast, with percentage caloric distributions of carbohydrate, protein and fat of 33.80, 7.82 and 48.38, respectively, was served with 300 mL of water for breakfast ad libitum. Each participant received a sandwich (110 g, 145 kcal) ad libitum in a separated room on a clinic day according to their appointment. Weight of the food consumed was recorded. A digital camera was positioned 2 m (face on) from the participants to record participant chewing activities, including meal time (minutes); timing at the first bite until the end of the last bite, bite size (gram/bite); weight of food eaten divided by bite number; bite rate (bite/minutes); bite number divided by minutes of meal time, chewing frequency (chews/minutes); chewing number divided by minute of meal time, chews (chews/g) and chewing number divided by gram of food eaten. The videos were interpreted by three researchers independently. The inter-observer reliability was examined using intraclass correlation (ICC). The results showed that ICC for all measurements was reliable (ICC ≥ 0.90). Participants were informed that the objective of the present study was to examine the effect of solid food on postprandial blood glucose. The results show that the maximum and minimum number of chews per bite was 50 and 15 (mean ± SD, 50.80 ± 15.24, 13.95 ± 5.03 chews per bite, respectively). The average number of chews was rounded up for convenience and used as a factor in Phase II of the study. Phase II: investigate the effects of chew number on energy intake, hunger, satiety, appetite, postprandial plasma glucose levels and insulin levels in both healthy weight and overweight participants. In this randomised cross-over design study, participants were separated into two groups (15 chews/bite and 50 chews/bite) with 2 weeks of a wash-out period. The day before the clinic visit, participants were requested to consume only fried rice with egg ad libitum for their dinner between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. No other foods or drinks were allowed after the provided dinner to prevent confounding factors of previous food consumption. The next day, participants arrived at the clinic between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. after a 12-hour overnight fast and a 24-hour period without exercise. At the clinic, baseline characteristics including anthropometry, hunger, satiety, appetite and plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were collected before breakfast was served. Each participant was asked to rate their hunger, satiety and appetite using a visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire developed by Hill and Blundell. Each VAS questionnaire was 100 mm in length and contained labels ranging from \u2018not at all\u2019 (score of 0) to \u2018extremely\u2019 (score of 10). After collection of baseline parameters, participants were served an ad libitum ham and cheese sandwich and 300-mL water for breakfast. In order to control for bite size, a sandwich was cut into pieces of 7 g each (an average bite size of lean and overweight participants results from Phase I study) before served. Participants were required to finish their breakfast within 20 minutes after the first bite. The VAS questionnaire and blood samples of postprandial glucose and insulin were examined at 0 (baseline) 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the test meal. Blood was collected using indwelling catheters at specified time points and immediately centrifuged at 2500 × g at 4°C for 15 minutes. Aliquots of plasma were separated and frozen at −20°C until glucose and insulin concentration analysis. Plasma glucose concentration was determined by the glucose oxidase method using an auto-analyser. Plasma insulin was determined using a chemiluminescence method at a Health Sciences service unit, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. Additionally, the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was measured as fasting serum insulin (μIU/mL) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5. Energy intake was calculated using the plate waste (the mass of the food served minus the mass of the food left over). A digital camera recorded the number of chews per bite for each participant to endorse study compliance. Four participants (lean = 2, overweight =2) were excluded since they did not comply with the chewing number requirement of 15 and 50 times before swallowing according to the study protocol in Phase II. All data of these four participants were excluded from analysis. All data are presented as the mean ± SD. Student's t-tests were applied to determine differences between the means for baseline characteristics and chewing activities variables. Energy intake data was analysed by two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) (status × chewing). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule to quantify the overall response to chewing. Postprandial plasma glucose levels, insulin levels and the AUC of the different tests were compared using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A total sample size of 14 participants in both lean and overweight groups would provide 80% power to detect significant differences of chewing on energy intake in lean and overweight participants. Differences were considered as statistically significant at a probability value (P value) of less than 0.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS, version 16.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).

        "dc:description": "Aim: This randomised cross-over design study aimed to investigate different chewing activities between healthy weight and overweight individuals and to determine the effect of chewing on energy intake and postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Methods: Forty-one participants were classified into healthy weight and overweight groups according to body mass index (BMI). In Phase I, bite size (g/bite), bite rate (bites/minutes), chewing frequency (chews/minutes) and chews (chews/g food) were recorded after a sandwich breakfast. In Phase II, the mass of a sandwich consumed after 15 and 50 chews per bite (results of Phase I) was recorded. Postprandial plasma glucose and insulin were also examined at 0 (baseline), 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes. Results: The results showed that the number of chews per bite was higher in lean participants as compared to overweight participants. Energy intake was highest in overweight participants who chewed 15 times per bite. Additionally, participants consumed less energy after 50 chews regardless of their BMI status. The results also demonstrated that 50 chews per bite insignificantly increased plasma insulin concentrations at every time point in both lean and obese subjects. Insulin concentrations were not significantly changed at each time point regardless of the number of chews. Conclusions: Overweight participants chewed less and ingested more calories. Chewing 50 times per bite could reduce caloric intake regardless of weight status, suggesting that slow eating via increased chewing may help to reduce energy intake during meals. However, chewing did not affect postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels in healthy young adults.",
