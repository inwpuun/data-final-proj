Moore has been prescribed in Thai traditional medicine for over 30 years for the treatment of ailments including asthma, inflammation, fever, cough, vomiting, and skin disorders. The phytochemicals from this plant have been identified as phenolic acids, flavones, flavone glycosides, glycosides, phenylpropanoid, and diterpenoid. The pharmacological activities both in vitro and in vivo have mostly been reported from crude extracts and not from pure compounds. This review, therefore, brings together information on the specific phytochemicals found in C. petasites in order to provide a guide to the natural bioactive compounds that are potentially used in medicines together with mechanisms underlying their pharmacological uses. All relevant information was searched for the terms of plant name, naturally-occurring compounds, and traditional uses from reliable databases, such as PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar, along with Thai traditional medicine textbooks. There was no specific timeline set for the search and this review selected to report only mechanisms studied by using standard compounds for their biological activities. Four dominant compounds comprising hispidulin, vanillic acid, verbascoside, and apigenin, have robust evidence to support their medical effects. Hispidulin was discovered to be possibly responsible for the treatment of cancer, osteolytic bone diseases, and neurological diseases. Other compounds were also found to tentatively support the uses in inflammation and neurological diseases. C. petasites extracts may provide an option as complimentary medicine, and or for the pharmacological development of new drugs derived from the phytochemicals found within.",

        "dc:description": "Clerodendrum petasites S. Moore has been prescribed in Thai traditional medicine for over 30 years for the treatment of ailments including asthma, inflammation, fever, cough, vomiting, and skin disorders. The phytochemicals from this plant have been identified as phenolic acids, flavones, flavone glycosides, glycosides, phenylpropanoid, and diterpenoid. The pharmacological activities both in vitro and in vivo have mostly been reported from crude extracts and not from pure compounds. This review, therefore, brings together information on the specific phytochemicals found in C. petasites in order to provide a guide to the natural bioactive compounds that are potentially used in medicines together with mechanisms underlying their pharmacological uses. All relevant information was searched for the terms of plant name, naturally-occurring compounds, and traditional uses from reliable databases, such as PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar, along with Thai traditional medicine textbooks. There was no specific timeline set for the search and this review selected to report only mechanisms studied by using standard compounds for their biological activities. Four dominant compounds comprising hispidulin, vanillic acid, verbascoside, and apigenin, have robust evidence to support their medical effects. Hispidulin was discovered to be possibly responsible for the treatment of cancer, osteolytic bone diseases, and neurological diseases. Other compounds were also found to tentatively support the uses in inflammation and neurological diseases. C. petasites extracts may provide an option as complimentary medicine, and or for the pharmacological development of new drugs derived from the phytochemicals found within.",
