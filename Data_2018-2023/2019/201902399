All rights reserved.Orchid growers in Nakhon Pathom province, Thailand, face issues related to salt water intrusion during high tides, which results in retarded growth of orchid plants. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of chemicals that can prevent NaCl-induced decrease in the in vitro growth of Dendrobium plants. Calcium silicate (CaSiO3) at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, and 20 mM and proline at concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mM were added to Vacin and Went (VW) medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl and cultured for 10 weeks. The results showed that Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019 plantlets cultured on VW medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl alone had only a 50% survival rate, whereas Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019 plantlets cultured on VW supplemented with 200 mM NaCl together with 5 mM CaSiO3 had a 100% survival rate and attained the highest fresh weights of all the treatments. Moreover, Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019 plantlets cultured on VW medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl together with all concentrations of CaSiO3 had plant heights that were significantly higher than those of different to the plants cultured on VW medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl alone. Thus, CaSiO3 and proline at all concentrations improved the survival rate and plant growth of Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019. However, proline concentrations over 5 mM decreased the survival rate and plant growth.",

The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of chemicals that can prevent NaCl-induced decrease in the in vitro growth of Dendrobium plants. Calcium silicate (CaSiO3) at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, and 20 mM and proline at concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mM were added to Vacin and Went (VW) medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl and cultured for 10 weeks. The results showed that Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019 plantlets cultured on VW medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl alone had only a 50% survival rate, whereas Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019 plantlets cultured on VW supplemented with 200 mM NaCl together with 5 mM CaSiO3 had a 100% survival rate and attained the highest fresh weights of all the treatments. Moreover, Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019 plantlets cultured on VW medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl together with all concentrations of CaSiO3 had plant heights that were significantly higher than those of different to the plants cultured on VW medium supplemented with 200 mM NaCl alone. Thus, CaSiO3 and proline at all concentrations improved the survival rate and plant growth of Dendrobium Sonia \u2018Red Jo\u2019. However, proline concentrations over 5 mM decreased the survival rate and plant growth.",
