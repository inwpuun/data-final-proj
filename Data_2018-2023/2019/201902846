The tool provides visual cards of concepts about Genetics with multiple AR markers (cards). An interactive experience provides students a multiple-choice format to respond to different cases (questions). Using a purposive sampling technique, sixty students from the 9th grade compared and selected AR markers to generate an animated twodimensional graphic with sound feedback. In addition, the students' learning scores were compared among the groups of different analytical thinking abilities who used single and multiple AR markers. The results found the potential of using Augmented Reality (AR) in supporting students' learning especially in improving analytical thinking ability.",

The tool provides visual cards of concepts about Genetics with multiple AR markers (cards). An interactive experience provides students a multiple-choice format to respond to different cases (questions). Using a purposive sampling technique, sixty students from the 9th grade compared and selected AR markers to generate an animated twodimensional graphic with sound feedback. In addition, the students' learning scores were compared among the groups of different analytical thinking abilities who used single and multiple AR markers. The results found the potential of using Augmented Reality (AR) in supporting students' learning especially in improving analytical thinking ability.",
