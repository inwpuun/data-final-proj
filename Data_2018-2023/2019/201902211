In response to the role of education in Thailand 4.0 era, there is increasing focus on the opportunities for Thai people to learn continuously throughout their lives by using ICT that improves access to educational services equally and efficiently in formal, non-formal, and informal contexts. For instance, Thailand Cyber University Project (TCU) has developed a strategic plan related to open education that will lead to a learning society and promote lifelong learning via ICT. TCU\u2019s flagship project over the past three years has been Thai MOOC, which is a national MOOC platform of Thailand. Using a research-based design approach, these two TCU leaders, Khlaisang and Thammetar, describe their analysis of the current conditions relating to open education in Thailand. They also discuss the results of a gap analysis and SWOT analysis of open educational operation and present the TCU 2018-2022 strategic plan on open education via ICT of higher education institutions. Finally, a Thai MOOC will be presented as a case study for promoting open education and MOOCs in Thailand.",

In response to the role of education in Thailand 4.0 era, there is increasing focus on the opportunities for Thai people to learn continuously throughout their lives by using ICT that improves access to educational services equally and efficiently in formal, non-formal, and informal contexts. For instance, Thailand Cyber University Project (TCU) has developed a strategic plan related to open education that will lead to a learning society and promote lifelong learning via ICT. TCU\u2019s flagship project over the past three years has been Thai MOOC, which is a national MOOC platform of Thailand. Using a research-based design approach, these two TCU leaders, Khlaisang and Thammetar, describe their analysis of the current conditions relating to open education in Thailand. They also discuss the results of a gap analysis and SWOT analysis of open educational operation and present the TCU 2018-2022 strategic plan on open education via ICT of higher education institutions. Finally, a Thai MOOC will be presented as a case study for promoting open education and MOOCs in Thailand.",
