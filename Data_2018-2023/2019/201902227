                "abstracts": "© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Nowadays, the incessant increase in infectious diseases is one of the most important and greatest challenges globally. Most of the commercially available antibiotics are ineffective owing to the development of drug resistance and adverse side effects. The drug or multidrug resistance results in higher dose administration of antimicrobial drugs, which may lead to severe toxicity to the surrounding cells. Therefore, the development of newer drugs is a necessity to combat such issues and also control the infection against pathogens. In this context, nanomaterials are emerging tools for controlling infections without development of any resistance. Several metal and metal oxide-based nanomaterials have been used as antimicrobial agents that efficiently control the infection against pathogens. Moreover, various nanocarriers have also been used for the delivery of antibiotics to improve their effectiveness against pathogens. Additionally, combined therapy, such as nanomaterials with commercially available antimicrobial drugs, are also used for treating infectious diseases, showing synergetic effects on controlling the infections. These nanomaterials have advantages over commercially available antibiotics such as cost-effectiveness, safety, prolonged effectiveness, and no development of resistance. The mode of action of these nanomaterials is mainly the generation of reactive oxygen species, disruption of cellular membrane, inhibition of enzymes, and synthesis of DNA. Despite the tremendous success of nanomaterials in infection control, long-term exposure-related toxicity remains a concern. Usually, extensive use of nanomaterials may cause adverse effects, as nanomaterials release ions into the environment, which kills some beneficial micro-organisms. This chapter summarizes antimicrobial nanomaterials for controlling the infection against pathogens and adverse effects on the environment, ecosystem, and human health.",

        "dc:description": "Nowadays, the incessant increase in infectious diseases is one of the most important and greatest challenges globally. Most of the commercially available antibiotics are ineffective owing to the development of drug resistance and adverse side effects. The drug or multidrug resistance results in higher dose administration of antimicrobial drugs, which may lead to severe toxicity to the surrounding cells. Therefore, the development of newer drugs is a necessity to combat such issues and also control the infection against pathogens. In this context, nanomaterials are emerging tools for controlling infections without development of any resistance. Several metal and metal oxide-based nanomaterials have been used as antimicrobial agents that efficiently control the infection against pathogens. Moreover, various nanocarriers have also been used for the delivery of antibiotics to improve their effectiveness against pathogens. Additionally, combined therapy, such as nanomaterials with commercially available antimicrobial drugs, are also used for treating infectious diseases, showing synergetic effects on controlling the infections. These nanomaterials have advantages over commercially available antibiotics such as cost-effectiveness, safety, prolonged effectiveness, and no development of resistance. The mode of action of these nanomaterials is mainly the generation of reactive oxygen species, disruption of cellular membrane, inhibition of enzymes, and synthesis of DNA. Despite the tremendous success of nanomaterials in infection control, long-term exposure-related toxicity remains a concern. Usually, extensive use of nanomaterials may cause adverse effects, as nanomaterials release ions into the environment, which kills some beneficial micro-organisms. This chapter summarizes antimicrobial nanomaterials for controlling the infection against pathogens and adverse effects on the environment, ecosystem, and human health.",
