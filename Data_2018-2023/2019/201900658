Background: The prevalence of burnout among nurses tends to be high worldwide. A better understanding of relationships between the study variables can help hospital managers apply effective programmes to reduce burnout. However, no studies have identified the structural relationships between these variables in one model, simultaneously. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to complete questionnaires from 444 nurses working in three Chinese general tertiary hospitals. The proposed model was examined by structural equation modelling. Results: The proposed model was partially supported by empirical data. The total effect of work stress on burnout was large. Both work stress and the perceived social support moderately and directly affected burnout. Work stress also indirectly affected burnout through perceived social support. Work stress directly influenced perceived social support and self-efficacy. Perceived social support directly affected self-efficacy. However, self-efficacy did not directly influence burnout. Conclusions: This study validated a model and identified a deep understanding of structural relationships between the selected variables among Chinese nurses. Implications for Nursing Management: Apart from reducing work stressors, hospital managers should utilize more social support strategies when designing intervention programmes to reduce burnout.",

Background: The prevalence of burnout among nurses tends to be high worldwide. A better understanding of relationships between the study variables can help hospital managers apply effective programmes to reduce burnout. However, no studies have identified the structural relationships between these variables in one model, simultaneously. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to complete questionnaires from 444 nurses working in three Chinese general tertiary hospitals. The proposed model was examined by structural equation modelling. Results: The proposed model was partially supported by empirical data. The total effect of work stress on burnout was large. Both work stress and the perceived social support moderately and directly affected burnout. Work stress also indirectly affected burnout through perceived social support. Work stress directly influenced perceived social support and self-efficacy. Perceived social support directly affected self-efficacy. However, self-efficacy did not directly influence burnout. Conclusions: This study validated a model and identified a deep understanding of structural relationships between the selected variables among Chinese nurses. Implications for Nursing Management: Apart from reducing work stressors, hospital managers should utilize more social support strategies when designing intervention programmes to reduce burnout.",
