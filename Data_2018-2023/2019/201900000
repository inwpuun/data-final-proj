This study aimed to gain consensus from experts on the nursing research priorities in Vietnam. A three-round modified Delphi study was used in this study. A focus group discussion among experts was conducted in round I to identify the nursing research priorities (n=23). Data in round I were analyzed using content analysis. In round II, participants were invited to rate the importance of each nursing priority topic in a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, which had a 74% (n=17) response rate. In round III, the questionnaire was returned to the experts (n=17) until consensus was reached. Data from round II and round III were analyzed to produce mean score and final rank. The top 12 research priority lists were identified, which included subthemes and areas of possible investigations. All priorities were classified into three groups in the rank order, namely: (i) nursing management and leadership, which included (1) nursing care quality, (2) management and leadership of nurse managers, (3) nursing image, (4) professional nurse competency, and (5) human resource management; (ii) nursing education, which included (1) knowledge-specific domain, (2) the linkage between education and practice, and (3) nurse teacher workforce; and (iii) nursing service, which included (1) adult nursing concern, (2) patient safety, (3) public health nursing concern, and (4) quality of life of patients and nurses. Consensus among experts was achiever, and the findings are considered as the basis of resources to the most essential research needs in Vietnam.",

This study aimed to gain consensus from experts on the nursing research priorities in Vietnam. A three-round modified Delphi study was used in this study. A focus group discussion among experts was conducted in round I to identify the nursing research priorities (n=23). Data in round I were analyzed using content analysis. In round II, participants were invited to rate the importance of each nursing priority topic in a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, which had a 74% (n=17) response rate. In round III, the questionnaire was returned to the experts (n=17) until consensus was reached. Data from round II and round III were analyzed to produce mean score and final rank. The top 12 research priority lists were identified, which included subthemes and areas of possible investigations. All priorities were classified into three groups in the rank order, namely: (i) nursing management and leadership, which included (1) nursing care quality, (2) management and leadership of nurse managers, (3) nursing image, (4) professional nurse competency, and (5) human resource management; (ii) nursing education, which included (1) knowledge-specific domain, (2) the linkage between education and practice, and (3) nurse teacher workforce; and (iii) nursing service, which included (1) adult nursing concern, (2) patient safety, (3) public health nursing concern, and (4) quality of life of patients and nurses. Consensus among experts was achiever, and the findings are considered as the basis of resources to the most essential research needs in Vietnam.",
