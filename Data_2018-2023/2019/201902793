The purpose is to develop an e-learning system to enhance problem-solving ability and team learning for higher education students. The research will start off with investigating the management of teaching-learning for e-learning or online-based learning and studying virtual-learning technology in order to apply it in the e-learning system. The research target will be 400 randomly chosen volunteers who are educators from the higher education system in Thailand. Based on the findings, an e-learning system will be designed with purpose mentioned above by using: 1) LMS system will be designed with Moodle Software; 2) Web-based tools 2.0 with cloud computing; and 3) Multimedia teaching aids. The research target for studying the designed e-learning system will be 18 randomly chosen volunteers from the higher education level for a period of 12 weeks continuously. During the study period, the researcher will collect data based on an observation of the teaching method; data from the students will be collected based on their problem-solving and team learning abilities. The data was statistically analysed using mean, standard deviation, one-way repeated measure ANOVA, and t-test. Outcome of this study shows that both skills improved significantly higher in the volunteer students studied.",

The purpose is to develop an e-learning system to enhance problem-solving ability and team learning for higher education students. The research will start off with investigating the management of teaching-learning for e-learning or online-based learning and studying virtual-learning technology in order to apply it in the e-learning system. The research target will be 400 randomly chosen volunteers who are educators from the higher education system in Thailand. Based on the findings, an e-learning system will be designed with purpose mentioned above by using: 1) LMS system will be designed with Moodle Software; 2) Web-based tools 2.0 with cloud computing; and 3) Multimedia teaching aids. The research target for studying the designed e-learning system will be 18 randomly chosen volunteers from the higher education level for a period of 12 weeks continuously. During the study period, the researcher will collect data based on an observation of the teaching method; data from the students will be collected based on their problem-solving and team learning abilities. The data was statistically analysed using mean, standard deviation, one-way repeated measure ANOVA, and t-test. Outcome of this study shows that both skills improved significantly higher in the volunteer students studied.",
