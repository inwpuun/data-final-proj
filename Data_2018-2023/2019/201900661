This study was aimed at determining the role of baseline sequence variations in the enhancer II (EnhII), basal core promotor (BCP) and pre-core (PC) regions of HBV genotype C in patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN). Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treated with 48-week PEG-IFN were enrolled. Combined response (CR) at week 96 was defined by HBeAg seroconversion plus HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL and HBsAg < 1000 IU/mL. Pre-treatment viral mutations were characterized by Sanger sequencing and NGS (Miseq Illumina platform). Among 47 patients (32 male, mean age 32.4 years), CR was achieved in 12 (25.5%) individuals. Overall, NGS was superior to Sanger sequencing in detecting mutations (61.7% vs. 38.3%, P < 0.001). Based on NGS, the prevalence of T1753V (T1753C/A/G) and A1762T/G1764A variants were significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders (8.3% vs. 51.4%, P = 0.009 and 33.3% vs. 68.6%, P = 0.032, respectively). No significant difference between groups was found regarding C1653T and G1896A mutants. The absence of T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations were factors associated with CR (OR 11.65, 95%CI 1.36\u2013100.16, P = 0.025, and OR 4.36, 95%CI 1.08\u201317.63, P = 0.039, respectively). The existence of pre-treatment T1753V, A1762T/G1764A mutations and their combination yielded negative predictive values of 94.7%, 85.7% and 93.8%, respectively. The presence of HBV mutants in the BCP region determined by NGS at baseline was associated with poor treatment outcome in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB receiving PEG-IFN.",

This study was aimed at determining the role of baseline sequence variations in the enhancer II (EnhII), basal core promotor (BCP) and pre-core (PC) regions of HBV genotype C in patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN). Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treated with 48-week PEG-IFN were enrolled. Combined response (CR) at week 96 was defined by HBeAg seroconversion plus HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL and HBsAg < 1000 IU/mL. Pre-treatment viral mutations were characterized by Sanger sequencing and NGS (Miseq Illumina platform). Among 47 patients (32 male, mean age 32.4 years), CR was achieved in 12 (25.5%) individuals. Overall, NGS was superior to Sanger sequencing in detecting mutations (61.7% vs. 38.3%, P < 0.001). Based on NGS, the prevalence of T1753V (T1753C/A/G) and A1762T/G1764A variants were significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders (8.3% vs. 51.4%, P = 0.009 and 33.3% vs. 68.6%, P = 0.032, respectively). No significant difference between groups was found regarding C1653T and G1896A mutants. The absence of T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations were factors associated with CR (OR 11.65, 95%CI 1.36\u2013100.16, P = 0.025, and OR 4.36, 95%CI 1.08\u201317.63, P = 0.039, respectively). The existence of pre-treatment T1753V, A1762T/G1764A mutations and their combination yielded negative predictive values of 94.7%, 85.7% and 93.8%, respectively. The presence of HBV mutants in the BCP region determined by NGS at baseline was associated with poor treatment outcome in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB receiving PEG-IFN.",
