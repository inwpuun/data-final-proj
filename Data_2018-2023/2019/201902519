The trackable learning material consists of a printed book and a mobile application. The application augments a virtual reality to a printed book, keeps a student learning log and sends it to the LMS. The proposed LMS contains only the required functions to work with the trackable learning material, which are the teacher registration, classroom management and report generating functions. Teachers need to operate the LMS manually. The collected students' learning log automatically generates reports in the LMS that show the performance and behavior of the students, information that the teachers can then use to adjust the pedagogy to be consistent with their students.",

        "dc:description": "Learning material is one factor that affects the performance of teaching and learning with a learning management system (LMS), so this research presents a trackable augmented learning media system that contains a trackable learning material and a cloud-based LMS. The trackable learning material consists of a printed book and a mobile application. The application augments a virtual reality to a printed book, keeps a student learning log and sends it to the LMS. The proposed LMS contains only the required functions to work with the trackable learning material, which are the teacher registration, classroom management and report generating functions. Teachers need to operate the LMS manually. The collected students' learning log automatically generates reports in the LMS that show the performance and behavior of the students, information that the teachers can then use to adjust the pedagogy to be consistent with their students.",
