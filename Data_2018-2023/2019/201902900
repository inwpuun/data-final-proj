                "abstracts": "© 2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.Equine Glandular Gastric Disease (EGGD) is a common disease in sport horses. This disease might be associated with usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating inflammatory diseases. Although gastroscopy has been an effective method for diagnosisbut a less invasive, and inexpensive method is preferred. This study used proteomic technology to identify candidate serum proteins that might be used as markers of NSAIDs induced EGGD. Five Thoroughbred horses were given high doses of NSAID, phenylbutazone to treat lameness. The experiment was divided into three periods: (i) Pre-EGGD period, (ii) during EGGD period, and (iii) Post-EGGD period. Gastroscopy were used to diagnose EGGD, serum was collected to perform gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in order to identify serum proteins in each group. The candidate serum proteins were computationally predicted for the interaction between phenylbutazone and proteins, tissue specific expression, and association to gastric ulceration. After EGGD induction, all horses showed clinical signs of colic with marked congestion and erosion appearing in the mucosa of the glandular stomach whereas no change was observed in the mucosa of non-glandular stomach. Our proteomic results identified 14 proteins that might be used as EGGD markers. These proteins were highly expressed in the glandular stomach and some proteins were associated with phenylbutazone or ulcer development. However, confirmation of these candidate marker proteins is required with specific antibodies in the larger horse population before they can be considered for application in the field.",

        "dc:description": "Equine Glandular Gastric Disease (EGGD) is a common disease in sport horses. This disease might be associated with usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating inflammatory diseases. Although gastroscopy has been an effective method for diagnosisbut a less invasive, and inexpensive method is preferred. This study used proteomic technology to identify candidate serum proteins that might be used as markers of NSAIDs induced EGGD. Five Thoroughbred horses were given high doses of NSAID, phenylbutazone to treat lameness. The experiment was divided into three periods: (i) Pre-EGGD period, (ii) during EGGD period, and (iii) Post-EGGD period. Gastroscopy were used to diagnose EGGD, serum was collected to perform gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE) and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in order to identify serum proteins in each group. The candidate serum proteins were computationally predicted for the interaction between phenylbutazone and proteins, tissue specific expression, and association to gastric ulceration. After EGGD induction, all horses showed clinical signs of colic with marked congestion and erosion appearing in the mucosa of the glandular stomach whereas no change was observed in the mucosa of non-glandular stomach. Our proteomic results identified 14 proteins that might be used as EGGD markers. These proteins were highly expressed in the glandular stomach and some proteins were associated with phenylbutazone or ulcer development. However, confirmation of these candidate marker proteins is required with specific antibodies in the larger horse population before they can be considered for application in the field.",
