                "abstracts": "© Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 2019Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) causes massive mortality in shrimp ponds within the first month poststocking. The causative agent is a specific strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) that has acquired the capability to produce virulent binary toxins called ToxA and ToxB. This study aims to test the effect of the addition of an autoinducer-2-containing cell-free supernatant (CFS) from the mutant Vibrio harveyi (VH) on growth and toxin production of VPAHPND. The relative AI-2-like activity in CFS was detected by luminescence assay. The effect of CFS (5 and 9%) on growth and toxin production of VPAHPND was evaluated. Compared to the control culture (without CFS-VH addition), the addition of either 5 or 9% CFS-VH affected the growth at the initial stage of VPAHPND. Similar growth profiles of VPAHPND were found with the addition of CFS-VH at both concentrations. Western blot analysis suggests that the addition of CFS-VH affected the production of both toxins. ToxA could be detected at the early hour post-CFS-VH inoculation, whereas the high amount of ToxB was detected when 5% CFS-VH was added. However, interfering with the AI-2 function with furanone, the AI-2 antagonist resulted in a slight delay in the production of both toxins. Results from this study will help to design a novel strategy to control AHPND in shrimp culture.",

The causative agent is a specific strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) that has acquired the capability to produce virulent binary toxins called ToxA and ToxB. This study aims to test the effect of the addition of an autoinducer-2-containing cell-free supernatant (CFS) from the mutant Vibrio harveyi (VH) on growth and toxin production of VPAHPND. The relative AI-2-like activity in CFS was detected by luminescence assay. The effect of CFS (5 and 9%) on growth and toxin production of VPAHPND was evaluated. Compared to the control culture (without CFS-VH addition), the addition of either 5 or 9% CFS-VH affected the growth at the initial stage of VPAHPND. Similar growth profiles of VPAHPND were found with the addition of CFS-VH at both concentrations. Western blot analysis suggests that the addition of CFS-VH affected the production of both toxins. ToxA could be detected at the early hour post-CFS-VH inoculation, whereas the high amount of ToxB was detected when 5% CFS-VH was added. However, interfering with the AI-2 function with furanone, the AI-2 antagonist resulted in a slight delay in the production of both toxins. Results from this study will help to design a novel strategy to control AHPND in shrimp culture.",
