                "abstracts": "Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Owing to the increasing world-energy demand, oil as the main source of energy, will be produced more by using technology especially alkaline flooding, one of the main enhanced oil recovery methods to produce more oil. It involves the injection of alkaline that can react with the petroleum acid to form an in-situ surfactant to reduce the interfacial tension between displacing and displaced phases and reduce the residual oil saturation, leading to the higher oil production. In Fang oilfield, Thailand, light oil production can be increased by using chemicals to reduce interfacial tension of oil and water. In this study, sodium carbonate is used as alkali to lower the interfacial tension with various conditions. Therefore, the objectives of this work are to measure the interfacial tension and to evaluate the effects of parameters such as concentration, pressure, temperature and salinity on interfacial tension reduction for oil from Thailand. The results present the effects of alkaline concentration on the interfacial tension. Also, the alkaline solution can reduce the interfacial tension significantly. Because, the alkaline can from the in-situ surfactant with the acid in oil to reduce the interfacial tension down to 0.6 mN/m. Temperature is also one of the parameters that affects the interfacial tension in the opposite direction. The increment of temperature would reduce the interfacial tension. The salinity has an effect on the interfacial tension in the same direction. The effects of these three parameters would reduce the interfacial tension. On the other hand, pressure has relatively less effect of IFT reduction. The results of this work can apply to increase more oil production for Fang oilfield with the optimum conditions.",

        "dc:description": "Owing to the increasing world-energy demand, oil as the main source of energy, will be produced more by using technology especially alkaline flooding, one of the main enhanced oil recovery methods to produce more oil. It involves the injection of alkaline that can react with the petroleum acid to form an in-situ surfactant to reduce the interfacial tension between displacing and displaced phases and reduce the residual oil saturation, leading to the higher oil production. In Fang oilfield, Thailand, light oil production can be increased by using chemicals to reduce interfacial tension of oil and water. In this study, sodium carbonate is used as alkali to lower the interfacial tension with various conditions. Therefore, the objectives of this work are to measure the interfacial tension and to evaluate the effects of parameters such as concentration, pressure, temperature and salinity on interfacial tension reduction for oil from Thailand. The results present the effects of alkaline concentration on the interfacial tension. Also, the alkaline solution can reduce the interfacial tension significantly. Because, the alkaline can from the in-situ surfactant with the acid in oil to reduce the interfacial tension down to 0.6 mN/m. Temperature is also one of the parameters that affects the interfacial tension in the opposite direction. The increment of temperature would reduce the interfacial tension. The salinity has an effect on the interfacial tension in the same direction. The effects of these three parameters would reduce the interfacial tension. On the other hand, pressure has relatively less effect of IFT reduction. The results of this work can apply to increase more oil production for Fang oilfield with the optimum conditions.",
