                "abstracts": "© 2019, The Author(s).The greybody factor from the black string in the de Rham\u2013Gabadadze\u2013Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory is investigated in this study. The dRGT massive gravity theory is one of the modified gravity theories used in explaining the current acceleration in the expansion of the universe. Through the use of cylindrical symmetry, black strings in dRGT massive gravity are shown to exist. When quantum effects are taken into account, black strings can emit thermal radiation, called Hawking radiation. The Hawking radiation at spatial infinity differs from that at the source by the so-called greybody factor. In this paper, we examine the rigorous bounds on the greybody factors from the dRGT black strings. The results show that the greybody factor crucially depends on the shape of the potential, which is characterised by the model parameters. The results agree with ones in quantum mechanics; the higher the potential, the harder it is for the waves to penetrate, and also the lower the bound for the rigorous bounds.",

        "dc:description": "The greybody factor from the black string in the de Rham\u2013Gabadadze\u2013Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory is investigated in this study. The dRGT massive gravity theory is one of the modified gravity theories used in explaining the current acceleration in the expansion of the universe. Through the use of cylindrical symmetry, black strings in dRGT massive gravity are shown to exist. When quantum effects are taken into account, black strings can emit thermal radiation, called Hawking radiation. The Hawking radiation at spatial infinity differs from that at the source by the so-called greybody factor. In this paper, we examine the rigorous bounds on the greybody factors from the dRGT black strings. The results show that the greybody factor crucially depends on the shape of the potential, which is characterised by the model parameters. The results agree with ones in quantum mechanics; the higher the potential, the harder it is for the waves to penetrate, and also the lower the bound for the rigorous bounds.",
