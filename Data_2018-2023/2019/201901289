                "abstracts": "© 2019 IEEE.This paper proposes a framework for implementing Smart-Energy@Chula system of IoTcloudServe@TEIN by using NETPIE security mechanisms. IoTcloudServe@TEIN project aims to integrate networked collaborative efforts of research and educational communities in the Trans-Eurasia Information Network (TEIN). Smart-Energy@Chula service has been developed on the earlier completed so-called CU-BEMS (Chulalongkorn University's Building Energy Management System) testbed with the technical support of CUBEMS IEEE1888 protocol server engine which aims not only to show on-site energy management automation but also raise people awareness. In practice, building automation system can use CU-BEMS cloud, which allows the sharing of function or micro-service resources, for real-time decision-making algorithm. For cloud enhancement, we also require a new channel means to enable the secured on-demand sharing of CU-BEMS OpenData repository via a herein socalled interworking service gateway. The development of the interworking service gateway in this research thus enhances the building energy management to be compliant with different communication protocols, which could be useful for researchers and manufacturers in the future.",

IoTcloudServe@TEIN project aims to integrate networked collaborative efforts of research and educational communities in the Trans-Eurasia Information Network (TEIN). Smart-Energy@Chula service has been developed on the earlier completed so-called CU-BEMS (Chulalongkorn University's Building Energy Management System) testbed with the technical support of CUBEMS IEEE1888 protocol server engine which aims not only to show on-site energy management automation but also raise people awareness. In practice, building automation system can use CU-BEMS cloud, which allows the sharing of function or micro-service resources, for real-time decision-making algorithm. For cloud enhancement, we also require a new channel means to enable the secured on-demand sharing of CU-BEMS OpenData repository via a herein socalled interworking service gateway. The development of the interworking service gateway in this research thus enhances the building energy management to be compliant with different communication protocols, which could be useful for researchers and manufacturers in the future.",
