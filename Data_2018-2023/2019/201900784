All rights reserved.Due to an increase in the import and use of pesticides, agricultural areas in Thailand need to be evaluated in term of the leaching risk of pesticides in order to prevent groundwater from being contaminated with pesticides. In this study, the attenuation factor/ retardation factor model (AF/RF), integrated with GIS software, was used to assess the leaching potential of the applied pesticides, consisting of atrazine, glyphosate, hexazinone, picloram, ethylene dibromide, and metalaxyl in Song Phi Nong District, Suphan Buri Province, Thailand. The results indicated that picloram had the highest risk of leaching due to the sorption coefficient (Koc) and half-life (t1/2) of the pesticide. The remaining pesticides had a lower risk because of their higher sorption by soils. Additionally, soil with a lower organic matter and higher average water flow rate through soil had a higher pesticide leaching risk than other soils. The results also showed that the groundwater in the study area was safe under the existing conditions, including and the current application rate of pesticides. However, long-term monitoring of pesticide contamination in subsurface soils in the area is necessary.",

In this study, the attenuation factor/ retardation factor model (AF/RF), integrated with GIS software, was used to assess the leaching potential of the applied pesticides, consisting of atrazine, glyphosate, hexazinone, picloram, ethylene dibromide, and metalaxyl in Song Phi Nong District, Suphan Buri Province, Thailand. The results indicated that picloram had the highest risk of leaching due to the sorption coefficient (Koc) and half-life (t1/2) of the pesticide. The remaining pesticides had a lower risk because of their higher sorption by soils. Additionally, soil with a lower organic matter and higher average water flow rate through soil had a higher pesticide leaching risk than other soils. The results also showed that the groundwater in the study area was safe under the existing conditions, including and the current application rate of pesticides. However, long-term monitoring of pesticide contamination in subsurface soils in the area is necessary.",
