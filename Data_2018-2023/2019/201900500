                "abstracts": "© 2018 Sanguanwong and Kongpolprom, published by Sciendo.Mortality rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are different, depending on severity, etiology, and management. To determine 7-day and 28-day mortalities, hospital length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) of ARDS patients, and factors associated with poor outcomes. A retrospective study was conducted to review the database of ARDS patients admitted in medical intensive care units (ICUs) at a university hospital between 2010 and 2014. The cases were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code-J80 ARDS. Of 266 patients, 11.7%, 44.4%, and 44% fulfilled mild, moderate, and severe ARDS criteria, respectively. The main cause of ARDS was pneumonia. The 7-day and 28-day mortalities, median LOS, and median MV duration were 31.1%, 69.3%, 18, and 11 days, respectively. Pressure control was the most favorite mode, used with average tidal volume (TV) of 8.63 (2.16) mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW). Recruitment maneuver was most frequently used as adjunctive intervention, whereas prone position was applied to 3.75% of the patients. One-third of the patients received neuromuscular blockades. The median 7-day fluid balance was +6,600 mL. The mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio during the first 3 days, cumulative fluid balance on day 3, and average daily calories during the first week were independent predictors for adjusted 7-day mortality, whereas Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, fluid balance on day 1, cumulative fluid balance, and average daily calories during the first week were independent predictors for adjusted 28-day mortality. The 28-day mortality of ARDS was high. In addition, TV and fluid balance were greater than protective limits. These findings indicated the potential improvement of ARDS outcomes in our hospital.",

        "dc:description": "Mortality rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are different, depending on severity, etiology, and management. To determine 7-day and 28-day mortalities, hospital length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) of ARDS patients, and factors associated with poor outcomes. A retrospective study was conducted to review the database of ARDS patients admitted in medical intensive care units (ICUs) at a university hospital between 2010 and 2014. The cases were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code-J80 ARDS. Of 266 patients, 11.7%, 44.4%, and 44% fulfilled mild, moderate, and severe ARDS criteria, respectively. The main cause of ARDS was pneumonia. The 7-day and 28-day mortalities, median LOS, and median MV duration were 31.1%, 69.3%, 18, and 11 days, respectively. Pressure control was the most favorite mode, used with average tidal volume (TV) of 8.63 (2.16) mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW). Recruitment maneuver was most frequently used as adjunctive intervention, whereas prone position was applied to 3.75% of the patients. One-third of the patients received neuromuscular blockades. The median 7-day fluid balance was +6,600 mL. The mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio during the first 3 days, cumulative fluid balance on day 3, and average daily calories during the first week were independent predictors for adjusted 7-day mortality, whereas Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, fluid balance on day 1, cumulative fluid balance, and average daily calories during the first week were independent predictors for adjusted 28-day mortality. The 28-day mortality of ARDS was high. In addition, TV and fluid balance were greater than protective limits. These findings indicated the potential improvement of ARDS outcomes in our hospital.",
