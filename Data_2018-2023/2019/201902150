                "abstracts": "© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.This study aimed to investigate the effects of Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and Elthylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the bioaccumulation and translocation of arsenic (As) by Mimosa pudica L. using soils with 5 mg/kg of added As and NTA and EDTA concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Soil and plant samples were collected every 30\u2013120 days to analyze the As concentrations in the soil, underground part of the plants (root), and aboveground parts of the plants (shoots and leaves). The results showed that the plants with EDTA concentrations of 100 mg/kg had the highest As accumulation. At 120 days, M. pudica L. had a higher accumulation in the underground parts (29.71 mg/kg) than in the aboveground parts (6.32 mg/kg), with statistical significance (p < 0.05). The As translocation factor in the aboveground parts was less than 1, indicating As accumulation in the underground part only. With EDTA concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/kg, M. pudica L. had the highest bioaccumulation potential of As of 8.00 and 8.44, respectively. However, this research did not examine the reaction between As and any growth promoters. Further research should investigate the details of such a reaction at the molecular level, as well as explore how fertilizer factors might affect the As absorption of M. pudica L.",

        "dc:description": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and Elthylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the bioaccumulation and translocation of arsenic (As) by Mimosa pudica L. using soils with 5 mg/kg of added As and NTA and EDTA concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. Soil and plant samples were collected every 30\u2013120 days to analyze the As concentrations in the soil, underground part of the plants (root), and aboveground parts of the plants (shoots and leaves). The results showed that the plants with EDTA concentrations of 100 mg/kg had the highest As accumulation. At 120 days, M. pudica L. had a higher accumulation in the underground parts (29.71 mg/kg) than in the aboveground parts (6.32 mg/kg), with statistical significance (p < 0.05). The As translocation factor in the aboveground parts was less than 1, indicating As accumulation in the underground part only. With EDTA concentrations of 50 and 100 mg/kg, M. pudica L. had the highest bioaccumulation potential of As of 8.00 and 8.44, respectively. However, this research did not examine the reaction between As and any growth promoters. Further research should investigate the details of such a reaction at the molecular level, as well as explore how fertilizer factors might affect the As absorption of M. pudica L.",
