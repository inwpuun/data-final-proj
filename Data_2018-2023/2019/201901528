All rights reservedObjective: Jagged1 regulates several biological functions in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLs). The present study aimed to evaluate mRNA expression profiling of Jagged1-treated hPDLs using microarray technique. Methods: Notch ligands, Jagged1, were indirectly immobilized on tissue culture surface. Subsequently, hPDLs were seeded on Jagged1 immobilized surface and maintained in growth medium for 48 hr. Total RNA was collected and processed. Gene expression profiling was examined using microarray technique. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. Cell proliferation and colony-forming unit assay were performed. Cell cycle was evaluated using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. Results: The isolated cells demonstrated fibroblast-like morphology and exhibited the co-expression of CD44, CD90, and CD105 surface markers. After stimulated with Jagged1, the total of 411 genes was differentially expressed, consisting both coding and non-coding genes. For coding genes, 165 and 160 coding genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were mainly involved in cellular interactions, signal transduction, and collagen formation and degradation while the downregulated genes were in the events and phases in cell cycle. Jagged1 significantly decreased cell proliferation, reduced colony-forming unit ability, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in hPDLs. Conclusion: Jagged1 regulates various biological pathways in hPDLs. This gene expression profiling could help to understand the mechanisms potentially involved in the Notch signaling regulation in periodontal homeostasis.",

        "dc:description": "Objective: Jagged1 regulates several biological functions in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLs). The present study aimed to evaluate mRNA expression profiling of Jagged1-treated hPDLs using microarray technique. Methods: Notch ligands, Jagged1, were indirectly immobilized on tissue culture surface. Subsequently, hPDLs were seeded on Jagged1 immobilized surface and maintained in growth medium for 48 hr. Total RNA was collected and processed. Gene expression profiling was examined using microarray technique. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. Cell proliferation and colony-forming unit assay were performed. Cell cycle was evaluated using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. Results: The isolated cells demonstrated fibroblast-like morphology and exhibited the co-expression of CD44, CD90, and CD105 surface markers. After stimulated with Jagged1, the total of 411 genes was differentially expressed, consisting both coding and non-coding genes. For coding genes, 165 and 160 coding genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were mainly involved in cellular interactions, signal transduction, and collagen formation and degradation while the downregulated genes were in the events and phases in cell cycle. Jagged1 significantly decreased cell proliferation, reduced colony-forming unit ability, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in hPDLs. Conclusion: Jagged1 regulates various biological pathways in hPDLs. This gene expression profiling could help to understand the mechanisms potentially involved in the Notch signaling regulation in periodontal homeostasis.",
