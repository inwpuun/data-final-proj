The objective of this study was to determine the level of stress and associated factors among the elderly living in rural areas of Thailand. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in two sub-districts of rural Thailand and interviewed 403 elderly persons. We used simple random sampling technique from a list of registered elderly individuals and conducted face-to-face interviews using a questionnaire. The questionnaire were piloted, validated and pretested beforehand. Multiple linear regression was applied for data analysis. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the University of Phayao, Thailand. Results. The mean age of the participants was 68 and two thirds (67%) were female. Less than 43% of the participants had moderate, and one third (34%) had high levels of stress. More than half of participants had low level stress management. Stress was significantly associated with alcohol and illness with a predictive power of 3.0% [(R = 0.173, R Square = 0.030) (p<0.05)]. Conclusion. We conclude that risk factors such as alcohol and illness affect elderly population living in rural areas of Thailand to a major extent in terms of stress.",

The objective of this study was to determine the level of stress and associated factors among the elderly living in rural areas of Thailand. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in two sub-districts of rural Thailand and interviewed 403 elderly persons. We used simple random sampling technique from a list of registered elderly individuals and conducted face-to-face interviews using a questionnaire. The questionnaire were piloted, validated and pretested beforehand. Multiple linear regression was applied for data analysis. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the University of Phayao, Thailand. Results. The mean age of the participants was 68 and two thirds (67%) were female. Less than 43% of the participants had moderate, and one third (34%) had high levels of stress. More than half of participants had low level stress management. Stress was significantly associated with alcohol and illness with a predictive power of 3.0% [(R = 0.173, R Square = 0.030) (p<0.05)]. Conclusion. We conclude that risk factors such as alcohol and illness affect elderly population living in rural areas of Thailand to a major extent in terms of stress.",
