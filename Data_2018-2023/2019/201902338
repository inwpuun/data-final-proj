Which activities of software engineering use AI/ML the most for solving research problems? The scope of the paper is to preliminary review research papers published in Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference 2018 (APSEC 2018) proceedings and researches conducted at the Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkorn University (CPCU). The author manually reviews papers with some keywords such as machine learning, neural network, and natural language processing. The result shows that machine learning is used in coding and software quality improvement activities more than other activities.",

Which activities of software engineering use AI/ML the most for solving research problems? The scope of the paper is to preliminary review research papers published in Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference 2018 (APSEC 2018) proceedings and researches conducted at the Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkorn University (CPCU). The author manually reviews papers with some keywords such as machine learning, neural network, and natural language processing. The result shows that machine learning is used in coding and software quality improvement activities more than other activities.",
