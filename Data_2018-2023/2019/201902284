Health workers were assessed for knowledge, skill and competency pre, post training in March, and 3months in June 2017 and 1-year post implementation in September 2018. Health workers were scored on knowledge, skill and competency. The mean score was obtained and repeated ANOVA, chi-squared test and Pearson\u2019s test was used to compare pre-and post-intervention and one-year implementation. Retention of health worker\u2019s knowledge, skill and competency was assessed using the HBB questionnaires, checklist, practical skill and drills, and were scored on knowledge, skill and competency. The scores were computed into percentages, mean scores and mean differences, and compared against scores at 3 months and 1 year. Impact on management of newborn asphyxia was conducted using a review of delivery registry at maternity and children ward scores were group into percentages, averages means, computed using the Chi-square test. Results: There were 53 health workers evaluated; 29 were in the intervention and 24 in the control hospital. There was marked decline in the knowledge (84% to 69.4% p=0.001), skills, (94.6% to 77%, p=0.001), competency for simple resuscitation (88.5% to 76.4%, p=0.36) and complex resuscitation (83.3% to 76.9%, p=0.001) in intervention hospitals. Health workers in the control had good retention and improvement of knowledge (50.6% to 61.2%, p= 0.004), skills (40.3% to 56.5% p=0.004), competency for simple resuscitation (38.0% to 53.1% p=0.001) and complex resuscitation (33.1% to 53.4% p=0.001). Conclusions: Health workers in the control hospital had improvement in retention of their knowledge, skill and competency. Newborn mortality decreased in both hospitals.",

Health workers were assessed for knowledge, skill and competency pre, post training in March, and 3months in June 2017 and 1-year post implementation in September 2018. Health workers were scored on knowledge, skill and competency. The mean score was obtained and repeated ANOVA, chi-squared test and Pearson\u2019s test was used to compare pre-and post-intervention and one-year implementation. Retention of health worker\u2019s knowledge, skill and competency was assessed using the HBB questionnaires, checklist, practical skill and drills, and were scored on knowledge, skill and competency. The scores were computed into percentages, mean scores and mean differences, and compared against scores at 3 months and 1 year. Impact on management of newborn asphyxia was conducted using a review of delivery registry at maternity and children ward scores were group into percentages, averages means, computed using the Chi-square test. Results: There were 53 health workers evaluated; 29 were in the intervention and 24 in the control hospital. There was marked decline in the knowledge (84% to 69.4% p=0.001), skills, (94.6% to 77%, p=0.001), competency for simple resuscitation (88.5% to 76.4%, p=0.36) and complex resuscitation (83.3% to 76.9%, p=0.001) in intervention hospitals. Health workers in the control had good retention and improvement of knowledge (50.6% to 61.2%, p= 0.004), skills (40.3% to 56.5% p=0.004), competency for simple resuscitation (38.0% to 53.1% p=0.001) and complex resuscitation (33.1% to 53.4% p=0.001). Conclusions: Health workers in the control hospital had improvement in retention of their knowledge, skill and competency. Newborn mortality decreased in both hospitals.",
