This kind of learning allows students to connect as a learning network without barriers or borders. It fully supports the use of equipment and technology to develop the skills necessary for life. The purpose of this research study is two-fold: first, to develop a research-based Open Online Assessment Management System (OOAMS), and second to develop the standardized measurement for an assessment of IL, ML, and ICTL for higher education learners. The sample group consists of 2,300 higher education learners and the methodology was divided into 3 phases: (1) developing the conceptual framework, definition, and features of IL, ML, and ICTL for higher education learners; (2) examining requirements, designing wireframes, and developing an OOAMS for higher education students; and (3) testing the quality of OOAMS for IL, ML, and ICTL using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmation factor analysis (CFA) statistical methods. The research result found that, first, the specific features of the system included development using PHP and MySQL database and the design to interact with users with a responsive UI framework. The system is compatible with MOOCs and the Open edX platform, or can be used as a stand-alone application. It can create, share, copy, and extend both Likert scales and rubrics evaluation forms. It can also generate reports in both CSV and PDF formats. Secondly, the results of this research provided a standardized measurement for assessing IL (49 items), ML (63 items), and ICTL (69 items). Also, it can be improved or enhanced for online learning in a ubiquitous learning context such as e-learning, blended learning, virtual learning and MOOCs effectively.",

This kind of learning allows students to connect as a learning network without barriers or borders. It fully supports the use of equipment and technology to develop the skills necessary for life. The purpose of this research study is two-fold: first, to develop a research-based Open Online Assessment Management System (OOAMS), and second to develop the standardized measurement for an assessment of IL, ML, and ICTL for higher education learners. The sample group consists of 2,300 higher education learners and the methodology was divided into 3 phases: (1) developing the conceptual framework, definition, and features of IL, ML, and ICTL for higher education learners; (2) examining requirements, designing wireframes, and developing an OOAMS for higher education students; and (3) testing the quality of OOAMS for IL, ML, and ICTL using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmation factor analysis (CFA) statistical methods. The research result found that, first, the specific features of the system included development using PHP and MySQL database and the design to interact with users with a responsive UI framework. The system is compatible with MOOCs and the Open edX platform, or can be used as a stand-alone application. It can create, share, copy, and extend both Likert scales and rubrics evaluation forms. It can also generate reports in both CSV and PDF formats. Secondly, the results of this research provided a standardized measurement for assessing IL (49 items), ML (63 items), and ICTL (69 items). Also, it can be improved or enhanced for online learning in a ubiquitous learning context such as e-learning, blended learning, virtual learning and MOOCs effectively.",
