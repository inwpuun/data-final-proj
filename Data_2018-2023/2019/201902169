This research was the quantitative research which used the data collection instrument as 1) questionnaire in order to analyze the data by using the mean (x ) and percentage 2) interview and 3) evaluated forms by using the mean (x ) and standard deviation (SD). The size of sample group was specified by the formula of Cochran (1996). The sample group which was measured through the questionnaire was the primary school teachers for 432 people and upper primary students for 612 people which affiliated with the Office of the Basic Education Commission of 4 regions in Thailand. The sample group which was measured by interview method consisted of the upper primary students for 10 people and experts for 7 people. Lastly, the sample group which was measured by the evaluation forms was 5 experts. The research result presented that the state and needs of mostly teacher and student was the ability of using the website device such as Social Media Search Engine Documentation Presentation Online. Most people had available computer and smartphone which were able to access the internet and necessary with doing the learning activities through the modern devices on website to reach the various sources of knowledge, increased the attention of learning, and applied the design model of fairy tales electronic book by the digital storytelling under the Gamification Environment to encourage the creation and happiness of learning. The summary from the expert found that the learning models consisted of 5 components; 1) Digital Storytelling, 2) Gamification Environment, 3) Role of Learners and Teachers, 4) The Learning Resources and 5) Measurement and Evaluation which contained with 6 processes (PENCIL Model) as 1) Planning a Story Map and Brainstorming, 2) Exploring Resources and Making Storyboard, 3) Narrative Storytelling, 4) Checking the Story and Reflecting, 5) Interactive Social Media Posting, and 6) Learning Evaluation. The PENCIL Model Certification Model Assessment was the most appropriate position which was able to use as the trial.",

This research was the quantitative research which used the data collection instrument as 1) questionnaire in order to analyze the data by using the mean (x ) and percentage 2) interview and 3) evaluated forms by using the mean (x ) and standard deviation (SD). The size of sample group was specified by the formula of Cochran (1996). The sample group which was measured through the questionnaire was the primary school teachers for 432 people and upper primary students for 612 people which affiliated with the Office of the Basic Education Commission of 4 regions in Thailand. The sample group which was measured by interview method consisted of the upper primary students for 10 people and experts for 7 people. Lastly, the sample group which was measured by the evaluation forms was 5 experts. The research result presented that the state and needs of mostly teacher and student was the ability of using the website device such as Social Media Search Engine Documentation Presentation Online. Most people had available computer and smartphone which were able to access the internet and necessary with doing the learning activities through the modern devices on website to reach the various sources of knowledge, increased the attention of learning, and applied the design model of fairy tales electronic book by the digital storytelling under the Gamification Environment to encourage the creation and happiness of learning. The summary from the expert found that the learning models consisted of 5 components; 1) Digital Storytelling, 2) Gamification Environment, 3) Role of Learners and Teachers, 4) The Learning Resources and 5) Measurement and Evaluation which contained with 6 processes (PENCIL Model) as 1) Planning a Story Map and Brainstorming, 2) Exploring Resources and Making Storyboard, 3) Narrative Storytelling, 4) Checking the Story and Reflecting, 5) Interactive Social Media Posting, and 6) Learning Evaluation. The PENCIL Model Certification Model Assessment was the most appropriate position which was able to use as the trial.",
