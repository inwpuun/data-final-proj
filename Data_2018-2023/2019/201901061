The participants consisted of seven multidisciplinary professionals who were working with special education teachers: one physician, one nurse, one social worker in hospital, one social worker in Office of Social Development and Human Security, one school psychologist, one clinical psychologist, and one occupational therapist. The data were collected by reviewing documents and conducting focus group. The data were analyzed using content analysis. The results revealed that: The current situation between special education teachers and multidisciplinary professionals was that systems for coordination and transition had improved form the past. Special education teachers function as effective coordinators between multidisciplinary professional, parents, administrators, and other teachers in the same school. The problems were that special education teachers didn't provide all information to multidisciplinary professionals and didn't use the information provided by multidisciplinary professionals in developing children with special needs. Effective collaboration between special teachers and multidisciplinary professionals relies on multiagency and transdisciplinary approaches and communication between special education teachers and multidisciplinary professionals are crucial for successful collaboration. Special education teachers and multidisciplinary professionals need to understand and be responsible of their own roles. In working together, there needs to be meeting, training, coordination, communication, and relationship between special education teachers and all multidisciplinary professionals. and multidisciplinary team in order to effectively support children with special needs.",

The participants consisted of seven multidisciplinary professionals who were working with special education teachers: one physician, one nurse, one social worker in hospital, one social worker in Office of Social Development and Human Security, one school psychologist, one clinical psychologist, and one occupational therapist. The data were collected by reviewing documents and conducting focus group. The data were analyzed using content analysis. The results revealed that: The current situation between special education teachers and multidisciplinary professionals was that systems for coordination and transition had improved form the past. Special education teachers function as effective coordinators between multidisciplinary professional, parents, administrators, and other teachers in the same school. The problems were that special education teachers didn't provide all information to multidisciplinary professionals and didn't use the information provided by multidisciplinary professionals in developing children with special needs. Effective collaboration between special teachers and multidisciplinary professionals relies on multiagency and transdisciplinary approaches and communication between special education teachers and multidisciplinary professionals are crucial for successful collaboration. Special education teachers and multidisciplinary professionals need to understand and be responsible of their own roles. In working together, there needs to be meeting, training, coordination, communication, and relationship between special education teachers and all multidisciplinary professionals. and multidisciplinary team in order to effectively support children with special needs.",
