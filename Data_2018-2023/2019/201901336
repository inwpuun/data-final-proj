                "abstracts": "© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) causes an immunosuppressive, runting, and oncogenic disease in poultry, posing a significant threat to the poultry industry. In Thailand, an unidentified disease associated with runting-stunting syndrome and neoplasia, resembling REV infection, has been continuously observed in several chicken farms. However, REV infection in Thailand has never been reported. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and genetic characteristics of REVs in chickens in Thailand from 2013 to 2016. Of the 130 clinical samples obtained from 29 chicken farms from 9 provinces located in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand, including the central, eastern, northern, and northeastern parts of Thailand, 51 samples (39.23%) and 21 farms (72.41%) were REV-positive. REV-positive samples were detected in all 9 provinces tested. Our results demonstrated that REV was extensively distributed in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence showed that Thai REV was most closely related to Chinese, Taiwanese, and the US REV strains isolated from different avian species and clustered into REV subtype III. This finding indicates that REV subtype III was predominantly circulated in Thai chicken flocks. This study is the first report on REV infection in chickens in Thailand. Our findings raise the awareness of REV as another causative agent of runting and oncogenic disease in chickens in Thailand and highlight the wide distribution of REV infection among chickens worldwide.",

        "dc:description": "Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) causes an immunosuppressive, runting, and oncogenic disease in poultry, posing a significant threat to the poultry industry. In Thailand, an unidentified disease associated with runting-stunting syndrome and neoplasia, resembling REV infection, has been continuously observed in several chicken farms. However, REV infection in Thailand has never been reported. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and genetic characteristics of REVs in chickens in Thailand from 2013 to 2016. Of the 130 clinical samples obtained from 29 chicken farms from 9 provinces located in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand, including the central, eastern, northern, and northeastern parts of Thailand, 51 samples (39.23%) and 21 farms (72.41%) were REV-positive. REV-positive samples were detected in all 9 provinces tested. Our results demonstrated that REV was extensively distributed in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence showed that Thai REV was most closely related to Chinese, Taiwanese, and the US REV strains isolated from different avian species and clustered into REV subtype III. This finding indicates that REV subtype III was predominantly circulated in Thai chicken flocks. This study is the first report on REV infection in chickens in Thailand. Our findings raise the awareness of REV as another causative agent of runting and oncogenic disease in chickens in Thailand and highlight the wide distribution of REV infection among chickens worldwide.",
